# GIST!

(Generic Immediate System for Tabletop)

Version 2.0

This ruleset is heavily influenced by the Free Kriegsspiel Revolution and Old School Renaissance movements, and draws inspiration from the renowned sci-fi RPG from the old school era. However, it is not restricted to any particular genre or setting, as it is intended to be adaptable and versatile. The rules are designed to be streamlined and flexible, allowing for customization and modifications, which are actively encouraged and embraced.

This revised version has been updated to include more detailed examples and explanations, while still maintaining the core principles of the original.
- Quick to read
- 2d6 only
- Index card character sheets
- Easy-to-remember rules
- Quick combat
- Freeform magic
- Hack friendly

## What is GIST!

GIST! is a roleplaying game that allows players to create and explore an imaginary world governed by a set of rules. Through structured player interactions, actions and events unfold, giving rise to a collaborative, evolving storyline.

In essence, players will take on the roles of characters within a fictional setting and make decisions based on the game's rules, which determine the likelihood of success or failure. The consequences of these decisions will shape the narrative and influence the course of events.

A game of GIST! takes place as a conversation between the Referee and the other players.
- The Referee sets up the situation, describes the environment and setting, moves the dialogue and actions of the Non-Playing Characters.
- The Players move in the imagined space of the game through their Playing Character, describing their actions and narrating their conversations. It is up to each player to decide whether to act out their Character or play them impersonally. Players may also ask questions of clarification to the Referee.

To play you will need:
- At least 2 players, one will cover the role of Referee. The ideal number of players is 3-4 players, maximum 5.
- At least 2 six sided dice (d6), preferably one set for each player.
- Writing instruments, index cards and sheets of paper for note-taking.

## Game Principles

It is important that everyone at the table feels comfortable and has the following principles in mind:
- This ruleset is intentionally streamlined and prioritizes storytelling over complex mechanics. If you are primarily interested in a game with detailed mechanical systems, there are other rulesets that may be better suited to your preferences.
- Although the Referee has different responsibilities than the other players, they should still be considered as a fellow player and should not shoulder more responsibility for the success of the game than anyone else at the table.
- The Referee does not compete against other players; their role is solely to arbitrate situations within the context of the game. They are responsible for maintaining consistency, ensuring fairness, and resolving any disputes or conflicts that may arise during play.
- GIST! is intended to be played collaboratively, with a focus on teamwork and overcoming challenges as a group. As such, competition between players should be discouraged in favor of cooperation and mutual support. The characters should work together to confront the obstacles and threats posed by the game world, rather than engaging in individualistic or adversarial behavior.
- Players should ask the Referee questions in a concise and straightforward manner. The Referee, in turn, should provide clear and detailed explanations of the potential risks associated with each action taken by the characters. This helps to ensure that players make informed decisions and understand the consequences of their actions.
- When describing an action, players should first provide a clear and detailed description of what their character is attempting to do. Only after the action has been fully described should the Referee request a dice roll, if necessary, to determine the outcome of the action. This helps to ensure that the narrative flows smoothly and that players have a clear understanding of the sequence of events.

## Safety Tools

It is important to remember that not everyone at the table may be comfortable with the themes or content addressed by the game, or with the actions of the other players. It is therefore important to establish clear boundaries and expectations at the beginning of the game, and to be sensitive to the needs and feelings of all participants throughout the session. It may also be helpful to establish a system for communicating discomfort or taking breaks if needed.

There are various safety tools and techniques that can help create a comfortable and safe environment for everyone involved in the game, such as [**Lines And Veils**](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/30906/what-do-the-terms-lines-and-veils-mean), [**C.A.T.S.**](http://proleary.com/2016/04/25/the-cats-method-a-story-telling-game-opening-ritual/), the [**X-Card**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SB0jsx34bWHZWbnNIVVuMjhDkrdFGo1_hSC2BWPlI3A/edit?usp=sharing), and [**Script Change**](https://briebeau.com/thoughty/script-change/).

It is important to familiarize yourself with these tools and techniques and to use them proactively to ensure that everyone feels safe and comfortable during the game.

## Character Generation

The essence of GIST! lies in resourceful protagonists confronting perilous situations and obstacles with strategic and assertive approaches, which are shaped by their unique backgrounds and abilities.

Both are determined freeform, but the Referee can help less savvy players by providing a list of both background and skills suitable for the setting, or help players define their character.

Character are streamlined and take only a few minutes to be made. Both playing and non-playing characters follow the same generation rules.

1. Determine attribute scores: Roll 2d6 four times and assign the scores to the character's stats as desired, or distribute 30 points among the stats as preferred.
2. Choose a background: Select a background for the character that reflects their past experiences and skills. The character is considered to have a Skilled Level skill in any task related to their background, and any necessary tools of the trade are assumed to be available.
3. Choose skills: Select three skills and assign 6 points between them. The maximum score for a skill during character creation is 3.
4. Establish character details: Give the character a name and an age, and select two items as starting gear.

## Attributes

1. **Shape**: both physical prowess (power and strength) and physical resistance (stamina and fatigue).
2. **Agility**: quickness, dexterity, deftness.
3. **Mind**: intelligence, common sense, creativity and knowledge.
4. **Soul**: emotional strength, personality, standing and spiritual power.

### Attribute Scores

An Attribute Score serves two purposes: it determines the Roll Modifier to be applied to Checks and it also acts as a freeform qualitative measure of the Attribute's rank.

| Attribute Score | Attribute Modifier | Attribute Rank |
|:---------------:|:------------------:|:--------------:|
|       2-3       |         -2         |      Poor      |
|       4-5       |         -1         |    Mediocre    |
|       6-8       |          0         |      Fair      |
|       9-10      |         +1         |      Good      |
|      11-12      |         +2         |      Great     |

Usually, a normal human being is limited to the maximum score of 12 (if any bonus is granted to the rolled score). Other beings may exceed this limit in the super-human domain. 

### Temporary scores

If circumstances impact negatively a character Attribute, its score may temporarily drop to a lower Level. For example, when a character with a Good Mind loses an intellectual challenge, their Mind may drop to Fair Level until it has recovered.

# Skills

Any useful skill, in a situation that requires a check, grants as roll modifier equal to its score. The total score of all the character's skills may not exceed twice the value of Mind score.

| Skill Score |     Level    |
|:-----------:|:------------:|
|      -1     |   Unskilled  |
|      0      |    Skilled   |
|      1      |   Competent  |
|      2      | Professional |
|      3      |    Veteran   |
|      4      |    Master    |

If characters attempt something out of their competence, they are Unskilled and suffer a Roll Modifier of -1.

Skills flavor and granularity are determined by the Referee consistently with the chosen setting and genre. The following is a generic list that can be modified and expanded as seen fit:

1. Athletic: agility, stamina, strength, sports
2. Artistic: creativity, artist, musician, singer, actor
3. Intellectual: knowledge, wisdom, medicine
4. Magical: rituals, cantrips, magic, ESP, supernatural abilities
5. Martial: brawling, wrestling, combat, warfare
6. Primal: will, insight, fortitude, sixth sense
7. Skillful: "hands stuff", tracking, burglary, sailing
8. Social: speaking, carousing, gossip, etiquette

> **Example**
> 
> Let's say that you are a player who wants to create a character for a GIST! game set in a fantasy world with magic and combat. You begin by determining your attribute scores. You decide to roll 2d6 four times and assign the scores to your stats, as you enjoy the unpredictability of random rolls. Your results are as follows:

> Shape: 8
> Agility: 11
> Mind: 7
> Soul: 9
> You choose the background of "Apprentice Mage" for your character, reflecting your past experiences and skills. As an Apprentice Mage, you have a Skilled Level skill in magic and are assumed to have any necessary magical tools at your disposal.

> Next, you select three skills from the list provided and assign 6 points between them. You choose the following skills:

> Magical (score 3)
> Athletic (score 2)
> Social (score 1)
> Your character's name is Zephyr, and they are 21 years old. For starting gear, you choose a wand and a book of spells.

## Action Resolution

Most of actions can be adjudicate from the context and how the player describes the character performing them. When the outcome is uncertain, however, the Referee may request a check:

1. **Opposition Check**: performed when two characters oppose one another. Both of them roll 2d6 and add modifiers, re-rolling ties. Who rolls higher wins.
2. **Difficulty Check**: performed, when the Referee determines a fixed difficulty, as follows:
   1. The Referee states the difficulty of the action, adding a situational modifier between - 2 and +2 to scale if needed.
   2. The player rolls 2d6 and adds the roll modifiers granted by attribute, skills or gear.   
   3. If the modified roll is equal or greater than 8, the action succeeds.

### Critical Rolls

A natural roll of 2 or 12 (without applying any modifier) is always a Critical Failure or Success, regardless of modifiers.

### Scaling Difficulty

If an action seems trivial within the context of play, the Referee will skip the check and allow the player to proceed.

If an action is impossible, the Referee has two options: 
1. break the action down into a series of simpler actions
2. declare the action impossible and move on with the story.

If an action is possible but requires a check, the Referee will determine if any modifiers should be applied based on the following difficulty scale, with most actions being of Average difficulty.

| Modifier | Difficulty |
|:--------:|:----------:|
|    +2    |    Easy    |
|     0    |   Average  |
|    -2    |    Hard    |

### Gear

Equipment can provide an advantage in the game that results in a bonus to the Check. For each useful item in an action, the bonus is +1. However, gear can be damaged or lost during gameplay, and the Referee has the final say in this matter.

### Armor

The thickness of armor determines the extent of damage reduction it provides, which can range from 1 (for light armor) to 3 (for heavy armor).

Here are some examples:

| Armor Type & Value | Fantasy   | Science Fiction | Modern           |
| ------------------ | --------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Light (1)          | Leather   | Energy Shield   | Tactical Helmet  |
| Medium (2)         | Chainmail | Hazmat Suit     | Bulletproof Vest |
| Heavy  (3)         | Plate     | Power Armor     | Riot Gear        |

### Example

> Let's say our character is named Sasha, a skilled thief who is currently infiltrating a heavily guarded mansion to steal a valuable painting.

> As Sasha approaches the mansion, the Referee informs the player that there are two guards patrolling the perimeter, making it a difficult task to get inside undetected. Sasha decides to attempt a sneaky infiltration and the Referee sets the difficulty check to -2 due to the high security.

> Sasha's player rolls 2d6 and adds their modifier for Stealth, which is +3, but since it's a difficult task, the Referee applies a +2 modifier, making it a total of +1. Sasha rolls a 10, adding up to 11 with the modifiers, succeeding in getting past the guards undetected.

> Now Sasha is inside the mansion, searching for the painting. As they enter the gallery, the Referee tells the player that the painting is kept behind a reinforced glass display case, making it a hard task to break it and steal the painting. The Referee sets the difficulty check to +2, due to Sasha's experience as a thief.

> Sasha's player rolls 2d6 and adds their modifier for Thievery, which is +4, and since it's a hard task, the Referee applies a -2 modifier, making it a total of +2. Sasha rolls an 8, adding up to 10 with the modifiers, successfully breaking the display case and stealing the painting.

> However, as Sasha is making their way out, they run into a guard who has noticed the broken display case and is on high alert. The Referee calls for an opposition check between Sasha and the guard.

> Both Sasha and the guard roll 2d6, with Sasha adding their modifier for Agility (+2) and the guard adding their modifier for Perception (+3). The Referee applies no modifiers to the roll. Sasha rolls a 9 and the guard rolls a 7, making Sasha the winner of the check, as they managed to slip past the guard and escape with the painting.

## Combat

Combat is a contested action that occurs in rounds. Each round, a character can take two actions, chosen from moving, attacking, defending, or using special abilities. It is also possible to perform a double action of the same type, at the cost of forgoing the other action.

During combat, the following procedure is used:

1. Determine initiative by rolling 2d6 and applying modifiers based on agility and relevant skills. The side that rolls higher acts first.
2. On their turn, each character can take their actions.
3. The round ends after all characters have taken their actions. Repeat steps 2-3 until the combat ends.

After applying all relevant modifiers, if a Critical is not rolled, the higher roll wins in combat.

Modifiers to Stats and Skills are situational and depend on the attack type. The Referee has to adjudicate which modifier is adequate for the situation.

### Damage

A character's Hit Points are equal to twice their Shape Score.

When an attack lands on an opponent, the damage is determined by subtracting the defender's roll from the attacker's roll. The difference is then applied as damage to the losing side, with the armor score reducing the damage.

However, if the defender rolls higher than the attacker, no damage is inflicted.

When a character's HP drops to zero, they become severely wounded and are no longer able to participate in combat. If a character delivers a blow to a severely wounded opponent, the opponent may die or be permanently knocked out of the fight. The victor has the power to choose the defeated opponent's final fate.

### Healing

After every combat, characters' HPs are restored immediately if they are higher than zero. However, if HPs are reduced to zero, the character must receive medical treatment immediately. If medical treatment is not feasible, the character must make a Shape Check with a target number of 8 or higher. If the check succeeds, HPs are restored by half of their total. If the check fails, the character must retire from any further action.

### Example

> Let's say our character, Max, is caught in a bar fight. Max is a skilled boxer and has a Shape score of 5, Agility score of 4, and a Boxing skill of 3.

> As the fight begins, Max and his opponent both roll for initiative. Max rolls 8 (2d6 + Agility modifier) while his opponent rolls 10 (2d6 + Agility modifier). The opponent acts first and decides to attack Max. The Referee determines that Max can try to dodge the attack using his Boxing skill. Max rolls a 10 (2d6 + Boxing skill modifier) while his opponent rolls a 7 (2d6 + relevant modifiers). Max succeeds in dodging the attack.

> On Max's turn, he decides to attack his opponent with a punch. The Referee determines that Max can add his Boxing skill modifier to his roll. Max rolls a 9 (2d6 + Boxing skill modifier) while his opponent rolls a 5 (2d6 + relevant modifiers). Max hits his opponent and the difference between the rolls (4) is applied as damage to the opponent's Hit Points. If the opponent's armor score is 1, then the damage is reduced by 1. If the opponent's HPs drop to 0, Max can choose the opponent's final fate.

> After the round ends, if Max's HPs are higher than 0, they are immediately restored. If his HPs are equal to 0, he needs immediate medical treatment. If medical treatment is not feasible, Max makes a Shape Check against 8+. On success, his HPs are restored by half the total. On failure, Max must retire from the action.

## Advancement

Whenever a situation arises in which a skill is particularly challenged, the Referee may offer the player an Advancement roll. The player rolls a 2d6 and must score 8 or higher to succeed. If the roll is successful, the character gains an additional level in that particular skill. This represents the character learning from their experiences and improving their abilities through practice and dedication.

## Freeform Magic

Magical skill allows a player to attempt to cast a spell by crafting a simple phrase consisting of a focus and a locus. The difficulty of the spell is set by the Referee, and the player must make a Magical Check to cast the spell. If successful, the spell is cast, and its effects are determined by the Referee.

As a baseline, here is the Difficulty level by Magical:

|    Magical   | Difficulty |
|:------------:|:----------:|
|   Unskilled  |  Hopeless  |
|    Skilled   |  Very Hard |
|   Competent  |    Hard    |
| Professional |  Moderate  |
|    Veteran   |   Routine  |
|    Master    |    Easy    |

Note that difficulty is situational and it is perfectly feasible in a desperate situation that even a Master may confront a Difficult task.

### Focus

There are five main foci a character must state to set a spell:

- **Convey**: to move/communicate
- **Feel**: to perceive/sense
- **Create**: to grow/mutate/heal
- **Control**: to manipulate/command/master
- **Destroy**: to weak/break/damage

### Locus

There are six possible loci for a spell:

- **Energy**: this include electricity and fire among others.
- **Matter**: every tangible and natural element such as objects, water, air and so on.
- **Time**: the space-time fabric.
- **Mind**: everything that deals with mental domains.
- **Body**: the physical part of a person or creature.
- **Soul**: everything that deals with spiritual force.

### Mishaps

Magical can be a overpowering skill or not, depending on the chosen setting. To balance the potential overpower of Magical skilled characters, the Referee may define **Mishaps** to make the use of magic more dangerous and risky.

Mishaps may be bland or severe and should cause injury, mutations or even the loss of Magical skill itself.

Here is a list of a generic mishaps, use it as a reference to flesh out your own:

1. **Backfire**: The spell affects the caster instead of the target. The caster takes damage or is affected by the spell's effect as if they were the target.
2. **Mutation**: The caster undergoes a physical or mental change, potentially losing or gaining abilities or skills. This could result in permanent stat changes, or cause the character to become disfigured or unstable.
3. **Drain**: The spell requires more magical energy than anticipated, draining the caster's magical reserves. This could result in reduced magical ability or an inability to cast spells for a period of time.
4. **Wild Magic**: The spell's effects are unpredictable or uncontrollable, potentially causing harm to unintended targets or creating unintended consequences.
5. **Corruption**: The spell taps into dark or chaotic magical energies, corrupting the caster's mind or soul. This could result in alignment shifts, moral degradation, or other psychological effects.
6. **Catastrophic Failure**: The spell fails spectacularly, potentially causing an explosion or other destructive event. This could result in damage to the caster or their surroundings, as well as potential collateral damage to innocent bystanders.
7. **Temporal Shift**: The spell causes a rift in the space-time continuum, resulting in unintended temporal displacement or time loops. This could result in the caster being transported to a different time or place, or being stuck in a temporal loop until they find a way to break the spell's effects.
8. **Summoning**: The spell inadvertently summons a hostile or dangerous entity, which may attack the caster or their allies. This could result in combat or other dangerous situations.
9. **Mind Warp**: The spell causes the caster's mind to become distorted or delusional. This could result in temporary or permanent mental illness, or cause the caster to behave irrationally.
10. **Curse**: The spell attracts the attention of malevolent spirits or entities, who may seek to harm or curse the caster. This could result in long-term effects such as bad luck, illness, or other forms of misfortune.

### Example

> Let's say our character, a wizard named Azura, wants to cast a spell to create a protective shield around herself using Freeform Magic. She decides to use the focus "Create" and the locus "Energy" for this spell.

> Azura begins by wording her spell: "I create a protective shield of energy around myself."

> The Referee determines the difficulty of this task based on the situation and the character's Magical skill level. Let's say the Referee decides that this task is "Hard" for Azura, who is a Competent wizard.

> Azura rolls a Magical Check against the difficulty of "Hard." She rolls a 9, and with her Magical skill bonus, her total roll is 10. This is higher than 8, so the spell is successfully cast.

> A shimmering shield of energy materializes around Azura, protecting her from harm. However, given the narrow margin of success, the Referee decides that there will be a Mishap for this spell due to the potential overpowering nature of Freeform Magic. The Mishap causes Azura's eyes to temporarily turn purple, and she experiences a slight headache.


> Azura successfully cast her spell with some consequences.

## Creatures and NPCs

Creatures are divided by size, having a different impact on their physical characteristics.
Sentient beings are effectively NPCs, but they have no limitations on characteristics and abilities like humans.
To build other creatures, the reference table below may be useful.

| Small      | 1d6   | 1d6     |
| Medium     | 2d6   | 2d6     |
| Large      | 3d6   | 2d6+2   |
| Very Large | 4d6   | 2d6     |
| Massive    | 5d6   | 2d6-2   |
| Colossal   | 6d6   | 2d6-4   |

## Advice for the Referee

As the Referee, your primary goal in GIST! is to create an immersive and challenging experience for the players. The game is designed to blur the line between the player and the character, allowing players to attempt actions that make sense in the game context, even if their character may not have the necessary skills or knowledge.

To achieve this, you should encourage players to think creatively and come up with innovative solutions to challenges presented in the game. The game mechanics, such as the freeform magic system and the use of Mishaps to balance powerful abilities, are meant to encourage players to think outside the box and not rely solely on their character's stats.

Tactical infinity should be the main resolution engine for any action. This means that the outcome of an action is not solely determined by the character's stats or the roll of the dice, but by the player's ability to come up with a creative and effective plan.

In GIST!, the focus should be on creating an immersive and interactive game world where players have the freedom to explore and make decisions that will impact the story. As a Referee, it's important not to overly structure the game with complex plots and predetermined storylines. Instead, focus on creating interesting and challenging situations that players can engage with and respond to. By doing so, you'll allow the game world to evolve naturally based on the actions of the players, rather than trying to force them down a specific path. As you resolve player actions and respond to their decisions, you'll discover together where the game takes you, creating an exciting and unpredictable narrative that unfolds through the actions and decisions of the players.
