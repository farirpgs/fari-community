# What is The Murk | The Murk

> _"I remember that day, that damned fog rushed forward across no man's land. I remember getting my mask on just in time. Even then, you could still hear the whispers admist the muffled cries of those around you. Who will forgive us? Who can forgive us?"_

**The Murk** is a tabletop role playing game of grim adventure, horror and drama, set in the World of Tellus, a place rocked by a cataclysmic event a generation ago.

Players take on the roles of heroes and villains cast into a web of mysteries, plots, exploration and cosmic horror as they carve their own place out of a society on the brink. It is the story of heroism, sacrifice, destruction and redemption that drives humanity to find it’s new normal after the end of the world.

## Basic Roll

The Murk uses a 3DX system with 2 dice nearly always being D6s and the third being a **Attribute** die based on the type of roll and the character's skillset.

These dice are totalled along with any flat bonuses given, and then compared to a **Difficulty Rating**.

If the roll's **Total** meets or **Exceeds** the **Difficulty Rating**, that roll is deemed a success and the intent is accomplished.

If a roll fails to meet the Difficulty rating and the Attribute die rolls a 1, this is called a **Botch**

A number of things can add or subtract from rolls, namely **Equipment**, **Suffering**, and **Potential**.

## Rolling Philosophy

The system aims to provide mechanics that can address most inquiries, while ensuring that the system serves the purpose of storytelling rather than overpowering it. Therefore, many of our mechanics are intentionally designed to be straightforward, following a set of essential principles that foster enjoyable and seamless gameplay. Here are some guidelines that all play can be expected to follow.

**Roll for Consequences, not Results**

We assume that individuals are reasonably proficient in carrying out everyday tasks in normal circumstances. If you're a skilled marksman, it's expected that you can shoot a gun accurately at a firing range for leisure. Professional drivers don't need to roll dice to remember which pedal is the brake and which is the gas. In fact, in a typical life, there are rarely challenges to one's basic skills.

However, the characters in the Murk don't lead ordinary lives. While their skills are significant, what truly matters is the outcome of their failures. The Game Master (GM) should only request a dice roll if there are consequences tied to a potential failure. These consequences can range from minor setbacks to game-changing developments in the story. The ultimate goal is to advance a captivating narrative, and no gaming table wants to get caught up in skill checks that bear no impact on the story or its characters.

**Let it Ride**

In order to maintain a smooth and engaging gameplay experience, we avoid getting stuck in a cycle of repetitive skill checks. We don't want sessions to become weighed down by a series of sneak checks for every guard encountered, or multiple driving checks for each turn while evading adversaries. That's where the "Let it Ride" rule comes into play. According to this rule, there should be no need for repeated skill checks unless the situation undergoes a significant change. This means that, for a single scene, most skills will only be rolled once outside of combat, ensuring a more fluid and immersive storytelling experience.

**Embrace the Rule of Cool**

In The Murk, we value the concept of "cool" moments that can push the boundaries of the rules in a fun and exciting way. While the characters in the game may not possess immense power, allowing players to occasionally stretch the rules to create memorable and enjoyable experiences often leads to the most thrilling parts of a session. If something is fun and cool, we encourage you to let it play out, embracing the spirit of adventure and imagination that makes The Murk truly special.

## Making Attribute Rolls

With the exception of **Injury Rolls** and Active Abilities, every roll made in The Murk will be a designated Attribute Roll. This means the following dice will be used.

- 2 six sided dice
- 1 attribute die equivalent to the attribute the action requires rolled

This will be totalled, and then any flat bonuses or penalties will be added to determine success or complication.

## Potential

Potential is a currency that is leveraged by players when the chips are down and something needs to occur. Potential can be saved up and stored during an episode, or spent as it comes.

Actors spend **Potential** doing a number of things

- For every 1 **Potential** spent on a roll, add 1 to the roll unless otherwise noted.
- Every Archetype has active abilities that require spending a number of **Potential** to activate.
- Those using Faith can exchange **Potential** for **Power** in a 1 to 1 trade during a scene.
- Those using Esoteria can leverage **Potential** to shield them from the effects of Backlash.

### Gaining and Losing Potential

Characters can gain **Potential** in a number of ways.

- The GM can reward Potential in relation to a complication they have presented to a Character.
  - This is often based on a Trait and will be accompanied by a **Severity** die based on the difficulty
- The Character gains 1 Potential when their **Attribute** die rolls higher than a 6 on any 3DX roll
- The Character gains X Potential when the d6s of the 3D6 roll are tied, X being the result of their **Attribute** die roll.

Characters can lose **Potential** in the following ways.

- Rolling a 1 on the Character's **Attribute** die during a 3DX roll causes the loss of 1 Potential

# Conjuring Esoteria

Esoteria functions as an **Attribute Roll** with additional steps after it completes.

## Casting Spells

Magic is intended to be dynamic, narrative, and unnatural. For these reasons The Murk refrains from providing explicit spells and capabilities outside a few key areas. There are thousands of Esoteria symbols so when describing magic, the Paragon can use whatever flourish or description they wish to dress the effects of their spells in.

Esoteria is cast using an Esoteria Attribute Roll. First the Actor describes the intent of the casting, and is given both a **Difficulty Rating** and **Magnitude** they would need to accomplish this. Upon making the check success is determined as normal rules, then **Backlash** is applied.

**Weapon damage is often set as the Magnitude of a spell for the purpose of attacks**

## Backlash

Esoterists are quite literally channelling stolen(or given) power from the Gods into their mortal frames. As such they must make an **Attribute Only** roll of their Esoteria VS the Magnitude and absorb Stress equal to the difference.

**Potential** can be used before the roll to gain a bonus on the roll.

## Rituals

Those possessing the latent Esoteric skill can use it to alter reality as they see fit. All that is required is a keen mind, a clear ritual, and a near limitless tolerance to sacrifice the things around you for the goal you have in mind. This functions as an extentsion of normal casting. A ritual effectively enables the Esoterist to make their Backlash rolls in small parts, taking multiple scenes to complete a great and powerful spell.

**For every scene a Esoterist uses a ritual, they may divide up their Backlash by 3 and roll those pieces individually**

## Calling on Faith

Compared to Esoteria, Faith is relatively simple, yet significantly more complex at activation. As part of any **Scene** where there is downtime, a Faithful may pray to their god.

During the prayer, they roll a **Faith Attribute Roll** with a **starting DR of 8+ any Sins since last Prayer**

If successful, they are awarded **Power** in points equal to the difference.

They may use these points at any time to perform **Miracles**

### Miracles

The Faithful may perform a Miracle by doing 2 things.

1. State the intent of the miracle.
2. Stating the Creed they are fulfilling for their god by doing this miracle - or -note which sin they are punishing.
3. Select the amount of Power they wish to use.
4. The Director then assigns a DR for the miracle

They then take a number of their Faith Dice equal to this Power value and roll.

All Power used is used regardless of success or not.

# Units of Time in Game

In The Murk, time is not measured in traditional units or hours. Instead, we emphasize the exciting and engaging aspects of your characters' lives, skipping the mundane details of everyday existence. The goal is to create a gameplay experience that resembles a gripping novel or a well-paced TV show. To achieve this, we use the terms Epic, Story, Scene, and Moment to capture the essence of significant events without delving too deeply into timekeeping minutiae. This approach allows us to focus on the most compelling aspects of the game, keeping the momentum and immersion at its peak.

## Season

An Season refers to a grand narrative encompassing a collection of interconnected stories, all centered around the same characters, themes, and experiences. Within an Season, multiple Stories unfold, shaping both the world and the characters involved. Just like the legendary tales of Gilgamesh, Beowulf, and The Odyssey, an Season comprises numerous individual stories that come together to provide a comprehensive and cohesive understanding of the events and adventures within its realm.

## Episode

Within an Season, there are multiple Episodes, each comprising a complete plot with a beginning, middle, and end. These Episodes encapsulate various adventures and quests, such as storming a castle to rescue a noble, exploring haunted tunnels, or unraveling the secrets of a deceased Magister. Each Episode is further divided into Scenes, which contribute to the progressing plot within the group and throughout the world. At the conclusion of each Episode, the characters are given the opportunity to reflect on their experiences, contemplate life, and hopefully undergo personal growth.

## Scene

Scenes encompass the various settings and events that players encounter and navigate throughout the game. They can range from a battle in a narrow corridor, to attending the wedding of the mayor's son, to engaging in a conversation with your greatest adversary. Scenes can be diverse and multi-faceted, but they are typically categorized into different types:

- Combat scenes involve intense struggles where life or death hangs in the balance.

- Social scenes revolve around navigating specific situations, where your actions and words have the power to shape the world around you.

- Skill scenes require expertise and problem-solving, such as crafting a peculiar artifact or stealthily infiltrating an ancient manor.

- Paranormal scenes explore the effects of Esoteria and Faith, involving encounters with supernatural creatures and abilities.

- Reflection scenes provide an opportunity for the party to rest, regroup, and engage in internal discussions about their recent experiences.

It's important to note that very few scenes strictly adhere to a single type, and often blend and evolve as the scene progresses.

## Moment

A **Moment** is just what it sounds like, a brief split second in real life. It's the cut of a camera to a person talking, fighting, or doing any 1 action. Moments are used in all types of Scenes.

# Combat

## Determining Initiative

Initiative in a conflict Scene is established by each participant in a scene making a roll to determine their Initiative Score. The turn order is then determined by the individual with the highest number, granting them the first opportunity to act. As the Moment concludes, Initiative is recalculated by rolling again and adding it to the previous Initiative, thereby setting the turn order for the next Moment.

### Outpacing

Outpacing happens when one Actor has an Initiative that exceeds another Actor's by five or more. In this situation, the Actor with the higher Initiative gains an advantage, receiving an additional +2 on checks against the opposing Actor for every 5 point increment they are above.

## Determining Distances

Distances play a crucial role in determining the impact of various elements on individuals. To maintain a streamlined gameplay experience without excessive calculations, we utilize a set of distance descriptors that effectively capture the necessary information. These descriptors categorize all distances into five distinct categories.

- Close represents proximity in melee combat and intimate conversations, indicating a range that is within arm's reach.

- Near signifies distances suitable for yelling and throwing objects like an ax, typically encompassing an area of around 30 feet.

- Far denotes ranges relevant to archery and sweeping hand gestures, covering distances of approximately 250 feet.

- Very far encompasses distances where individuals' features are barely discernible and long-range weaponry like rifles come into play, typically within 500 feet.

- Distant refers to distances where only vague shapes of people are visible, offering little detail. This range extends to around 1000 feet.

## In Melee

When in close proximity during a combat scene characters are immediately drawn into a Melee when attacking or Attacked.

In a Melee characters engage in a Roll-off each Moment. The winner applying damage equal to the difference in Rolls plus their weapon damage.

When engaging multiple foes, the character must make a Roll-off vs the highest roll from the group of foes. Damaging a group always starts at the lowest Attribute die and ends with the highest.

**Instead of damaging their foes, Characters can choose to escape the Melee and move to the Near distance**

_Melee happens before shootouts and Duels of Magic_

## Shootouts

When in Near or greater proximity during a combat scene characters, and holding ranged weapons, Characters can choose to engage in a shootout.

In a Shootout characters engage in a Roll-off each Moment. The winner applying damage equal to the difference in Rolls plus their weapon damage.

When engaging multiple foes, the character must make a Roll-off vs the highest roll from the group of foes. Damaging a group always starts at the lowest Attribute die and ends with the highest.

**Characters can leave a shootout by getting Close or hunkering down and taking no actions**

_Shootouts happen after Melees but before duels of Magic_

## Contest of Powers

When in Near or greater proximity during a combat scene characters who posess Esoteria or Faith can choose to engage in a Contest of Powers.

In a Duel of Powers characters engage in a Roll-off each Moment. The winner applying damage equal to their total roll.

_Faithful must spend 1 Power per moment to Contest_

_Esoterists must take 5 strain each moment to continue the Contest_

When engaging multiple foes, the character must make a Roll-off vs the highest roll from the group of foes. Damaging a group always starts at the lowest Attribute die and ends with the highest.

**Characters can leave a Contest of Power by getting Close or hunkering down and taking no actions**

_Contests of Power happen at the end of the round_

## Into the Fray

People outside Melees, Shootouts, and Contests can often help determine the results. Make an Attribute check for every action you wish to perform outside these mechanics.

## Social and Spiritual Conflict

Engaging in Social or Direct Spiritual combat mirrors Physical combat, commencing with defined objectives for each participant. Each Actor involved in a social situation can opt to attack or defend by utilizing various social or spiritual skills. Through Roll-offs and immersive role-playing, the participants strive to achieve their goals. The winner applying damage equal to their total roll.

### Losing an Argument or Contest

Alternatively, instead of incurring a rank of Suffering, an Actor may choose to concede the argument and allow their opponent's objective to prevail.

# Damage, Death, and Recovery

## Resisting and Dealing Damage

Every weapon and ability has an associated damage rating. This rating is applied when a hit is achieved or a Roll-off is won.

Often damage is applied to the Damage track, but special weapons or even social combat will apply damage to the Strain or Exhaustion tracks.

A base Weapon's Damage is 7 but can vary greatly on quality and size. A cannon does more damage than a dagger, but the greatest magical dagger may be able to outshine a cannon.

_See Quality Tiers for more information_

### Armor

Armor is designed to add bonus dice to your Injury Tracks. Most Armor is physical and applied to your Damage dice pool, but others can be Strain or Exhaustion based.

Armor always uses the associated Attribute die for the Attribute.

## The Injury Tracks

The well-being of characters is intricately tied to their Core Attributes. Three Injury tracks exist, each influenced by these attributes. These tracks are independently monitored and reset at the beginning of each new scene. When damage is inflicted on a track, a corresponding roll must be made. Throughout the scene, whenever damage occurs, a reroll of the new total is required. Injury tracks are based on core attributes for the dice type, and rank for the total number of dice.

The three Injury Dice Types are as follows:

- Damage - Equal to Body Dice

- Strain - Equal to Mind Dice

- Exhaustion - Equal to Spirit Dice

**_The Total number of Dice for each Injury Track is 2+Rank_**

**These rolls 'explode' meaning the highest value of each die results in an additional die being rolled and added to the total.**

Success in these rolls signifies that no lasting effects occur. However, failure to meet the track number results in a rank of Suffering. The total ranks of Suffering incurred reduce the effectiveness of all core attributes accordingly.

## Suffering and Breaking Down

Suffering is the aggregated stress and damage that a Character has taken to their spirtual, moral, and physical self.

Suffering Manifests itself in a set of Ranks. When a new Rank of Suffering is applied from damage, strain, or exhaustion a **Break Down** roll is made.

**Breakdown Roll** is the new total of Suffering Ranks Rolled as D6s. If this total exceeds 20 this character dies or retires from play at the end of the scene.

## Recovery

The more weary of this world a character's body and mind are the more difficult it can be to pull them from the brink.

Recovery can occur when the Character spends an entire scene seeking medical, spiritual, or mental care.

_The intent is to take this character out of action and focus on their healing or internal dialogues_

At the end of the Scene, the Character or those aiding them may make a Attribute Rolloff vs the Character's Breakdown Roll total.

\*_Recovery does not count toward Breakdown rolls for the purposes of retirement or death_

Alternatively, the Director can freely recover 1 or more Suffering at the end of an Episode.

# Equipment

## Quality Tiers

Equipment Tiers categorize the quality and effectiveness of various items in Tellus. Whether it's a worn-out blade or an exquisitely enchanted weapon, the quality of equipment can greatly impact its performance. There are six tiers of equipment, each with its own mechanical benefits:

- Tier 1 - Terrible: Low-quality tools that adds -1 penalty to rolls and can break on a botch.

- Tier 2 - Standard: Average equipment that grants no penalty or bonus to checks.

- Tier 3 - Finely Crafted: Handcrafted items by skilled artisans, providing +1 to any check used.

- Tier 4 - Masterwork: Exceptionally crafted non-magical items that add +2 to any check.

- Tier 5 - Enchanted: Magical items that allow one reroll of 1s on Attribute Dice per scene and also function as Masterwork tools.

- Tier 6 - Artifact: Extraordinary items that provide +3 dice on use and allow one full reroll per scene.

## Weapons

All weapon stats can be reskinned and stylized as both the Actor or Director see fit. Overall the intent is to provide freedom of expression while maintaining some semblance of realism for weaponry.

| Weapon         | Description                                                                                                               | Range | Damage | Cost       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ------ | ---------- |
| Rifle          | Long-range firearms with rifled barrels, capable of accurate and powerful shots.                                          | Far   | 8+     | 6 per Tier |

## Armor, Gear, and Prosthetics

Much like Weapons, all equipment can be reskinned to fit the need of any Actor or Director.

| Equipment   | Example                                                                     | Effect                                                                                              | Cost       |

# Character Details

Archtypes are intended to provide some framework to a Character's skillset and play style. They are a loose collection of Attributes and Talents that intend to paint _part but not all_ of a Character's picture.

## Ranks and Progression

Much like Archetypes, every character has an associated **Rank**. Ranks are a rough determination of capability in relation to others. At the beginning, all Characters have a rank of 1.

Ranks determine a number of things such as

- Basic Injury Dice Pools
- New Talent Costs
- Attribute Maximums

Below is a list of the Ranks and their details.

| Rank           | XP Req | Injury Dice Pool | Talent Costs | Attribute Maximum |
| -------------- | ------ | ---------------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| 1 - Green      | 0      | 3                | 20           | D10               |
| 2 - Freelancer | 100    | 4                | 30           | D10               |
| 3 - Journeyman | 250    | 4                | 40           | D12               |
| 4 - Veteran    | 450    | 5                | 50           | D12               |
| 5 - Legendary  | 700    | 5                | 50           | D20               |

## Archetypes

| Archetype | Description                                                                                                                      | Body | Mind | Spirit | Initiative | Faith | Esoteria | Wealth |

# The World of The Murk

## Why Include Setting in an SRD?

The Murk's setting is just as important as the rules it plays by. The Gods, history, and the reasons magic work in the ways it does is tied inexorably to the world it exists in. As such, The Murk is not setting agnostic and in an effort to make sure _everyone_ is able to pick up and play, the introductory information is presented here.

## Introduction

The world, once vibrant and full of promise, now stands on the precipice of failure and decay. It is a gradual decline that may span centuries, but the eventual outcome seems inevitable: humanity, without some extraordinary salvation, will wither away, fading into oblivion, leaving behind nothing but a distant memory.

Amidst this impending catastrophe, the Princes and their Councils are not oblivious to the looming doom. Some among them tirelessly dedicate their efforts towards salvaging whatever remnants of hope and prosperity they can for their people. These noble souls toil day and night, driven by a desperate desire to stave off the encroaching darkness. However, not all are burdened by such noble intentions; there are those who indulge in reckless hedonism, engaging in lavish feasts and orgies, seeking fleeting pleasures as a means to distract themselves from the grim reality that surrounds them.

In the face of uncertainty and despair, the once-grand Cathedrals have become sanctuaries overflowing with desperate parishioners. Their anguished voices rise in fervent supplication, beseeching their deities for deliverance from the impending doom. Some gods answer their pleas, offering solace and guidance in these trying times, while others remain ominously silent, their intentions and existence questioned by the disillusioned masses. The distinction between divine intervention and divine indifference has blurred, leaving the faithful in a state of confusion and doubt.

Meanwhile, the towering Spires of the High Magisters buzz with ceaseless activity. These learned scholars and wielders of great magical power devote themselves tirelessly to preserve what shreds of humanity's legacy remain. Consumed by guilt for their perceived role in bringing about this calamitous state of affairs, they bear the weight of their hubris as the ultimate sin of mankind. Their tireless efforts serve as a testament to the depths of their remorse and the earnest desire to rectify the grave mistakes that have led to this precipice of destruction.

However, amidst the struggles of the ruling elite, the common folk find themselves caught in a downward spiral of worsening circumstances. The ravages of war have left scars that are not easily healed, as their sons and daughters were sent off to battle, compelled by duty and loyalty to defend their homeland. These brave souls returned forever changed, their spirits weighed down by the atrocities they witnessed and the deeds they were forced to commit. Gazing upon their own children, born into a world defined by chaos and suffering, they lament the loss of innocence and wonder what might have been in a world untouched by the horrors they have endured.

Such is the backdrop against which the tale of The Murk unfolds—a haunting narrative that chronicles the fate of those who have survived a world that has been reduced to ruins. It is a world that has witnessed the pinnacle of human achievement, only to descend into the abyss of despair and desolation.

---

The promise of a brave new world, envisioned by those who dedicated centuries of arduous work, relentless study, ceaseless effort, and unyielding progress, now seems like a cruel mockery of their endeavors. A priest of Le Vides, speaking in the year 5 After The Black Day, encapsulates the collective disillusionment: "How can this ruin be the reward for such pursuit?" The Vardan Empire, once a formidable bastion of power and unity, now stands fractured and fragmented. The central authority of the emperor, the might of his legions, and the sanctity of his laws have all faded into the annals of memory, mere vestiges of a bygone era.

In the wake of the empire's disintegration, the various principalities vie for supremacy, engaging in bitter power struggles among themselves, yet momentarily uniting only in the face of existential threats that threaten their very existence.

Amidst this desolation, a glimmer of hope once shone through the industrialization of magic—an innovation that brought a flicker of light to the beleaguered Empire. The fusion of Esoteria, the mystical arts, with assembly techniques created a revolutionary capacity to sustain, shelter, and arm a large population within the confines of relatively small territories. This newfound growth in production served as a boon for over a century, rekindling a sense of optimism and rejuvenation within the old Empire. Many anticipated that this resurgence would pave the way for a grand unification, a harmonious gathering of all former subjects under a banner of collective prosperity.

However, instead of achieving the long-awaited unity, this industrialized magic inadvertently became a bane, a catalyst that crippled the region. The Great War erupted, waged relentlessly between the bickering principalities and the encroaching Far Lands, their alliances in a constant state of flux. The heartland of the Vardan lands became the epicenter of this devastating conflict. Then, in an event shrouded in mystery, known simply as "The The Black Day," the Vardan homeland succumbed to an unimaginable magical catastrophe of cataclysmic proportions.

---

The details of the event remain cloaked in uncertainty, the truth obscured by the swirling fog of history. No one can definitively say what transpired or who was responsible for the The Black Day that befell the battle-scarred land. However, the Battle of Doria, a pivotal moment in the war, ended in eerie silence, followed by a cataclysmic explosion. From the aftermath of this detonation emerged a sinister sea of black fog, stretching for miles into the sky, mercilessly swallowing all life within its malevolent embrace. Thus, "The Murk" was born, an ominous testament to the irreversible destruction that had befallen the Vardan homeland.

Today, the Murk stands as a hauntingly silent gateway into the heart of the old Empire—a chilling reminder of the tragedies that have unfolded. While the principalities slowly begin to recover from the devastation, the deep-seated grudges and animosities of the past three decades have not been extinguished; they merely lie dormant, waiting for the opportune moment to resurface and ignite once again.

In the face of impending doom and the shattered remnants of a once-great civilization, the fate of the world hangs in the balance. Will humanity find the strength and resilience to rise above the ashes and forge a new future, or will they succumb to the inexorable forces of decay and be consigned to the annals of forgotten history? Only time will tell as the tale of The Murk continues to unfold, chronicling the journey of those who dare to navigate the treacherous path that lies ahead.

# Lands of Tellus

While Tellus's wonders span far and wide, this supplement zeroes in on the heart of the central continent, particularly within the former territories of the illustrious Vardan Empire and the surrounding nations. While our focus is primarily on the former Empire’s peoples and their lands, it is crucial to note that this supplement does not claim to be an exhaustive compendium of all the peoples and territories that exist within the vast reaches of Tellus.

## Doria: The Legacy of Varranthal

![The Remnants of Doria](https://gyazo.com/ba68b0b6ad582ebb51c99795ac344d22)

Set deep within the heart of the old Vardan Empire, the lands that would later become the country of Doria hold an illustrious history. This region served as the birthplace of the original sixteen emperors, a testament to its significance as the pinnacle of power on all of Tellus. Indeed, the entirety of Doria was intricately intertwined with the legacy of the Vardan Empire, sharing not only its territories but also a capital city that remained unchanged—Varranthal.

The zenith of Doria's influence and supremacy began to wane following the ascension of Emperor Regieran to the realm beyond in 1331 BBD. In the wake of his departure, the empire descended into a tumultuous era of internal strife, characterized by intense power struggles and a revolving door of rulers.

Yet, amid the political turmoil, Doria experienced a resurgence under the reign of King Arminus Magnus, who ascended the throne in 745 BBD. With remarkable acumen, Arminus Magnus consolidated the fragmented political and military landscape, ushering in a new golden era for Doria. During this transformative period, the nation reclaimed much of its former homeland, reestablishing control over conquered territories and asserting dominance over neighboring regions. The conquest even extended southward, as Doria ventured into Kemet, subjugating the land while maintaining a puppet ruler in place. Although the empire did not retain the cohesion of its earlier days, Doria's influence reigned supreme for nearly 1600 years.

However, the tides of fate took an irreversible turn with the advent of The Black Day in 0 AC. As the catastrophic event unfolded, Doria found itself at the epicenter, its lands consumed by the insidious Murk—a rolling sea of malevolent black fog that devoured all in its path. The once-thriving nation became a desolate wasteland, with its people either perishing instantaneously or vanishing without a trace beneath the suffocating veil of the Murk. Only the expatriate Dorians managed to escape the grim fate, seeking refuge in the other nearby lands. Among these lands, Kemmet became the destination for the largest contingent of exiled Dorians, resulting in a complex social dynamic—a fragile caste system that grapples with the integration of Dorians and the indigenous population.

Today, the remnants of Doria stand as a haunting testament to the ravages of The Black Day and the enduring impact of the Murk. Varranthal, the capital city that once symbolized the might of the Vardan Empire, now lies silent and lifeless—a ghostly reminder of the nation's former grandeur. The scattered survivors of Doria's fall carry with them the weight of a shattered legacy and the indomitable spirit to rebuild amidst the shadows.

### Dorians at a Glance

![A Dorian Family in Exile](https://gyazo.com/48f1b2166d01eb172d28a9b7aea032fd)

**Noble Houses and Ancestral Lineage:**

Within the remnants of the Vardan Empire, the noble houses hold a prominent position in society, serving as the bedrock of political influence and social standing. Many individuals in the Near Lands take great pride in tracing their ancestry back to the Vardan Empire, as it signifies a connection to a glorious past and the fabled bloodlines of the imperial rulers.

The noble houses, often referred to as the "Houses of Legacy," are custodians of traditions, heritage, and the remnants of Vardan culture. They meticulously maintain extensive genealogical records, carefully documenting the lineage of their families, and proudly displaying their prestigious heritage. These ancestral connections are seen as a source of honor and legitimacy, granting the nobility a sense of entitlement and authority.

**Extensive Guild Systems:**

In the fabric of Doria's society, an intricate and elaborate guild system thrives, woven into the very essence of everyday life. These guilds are associations of skilled artisans, merchants, and professionals who come together to protect their trade secrets, uphold quality standards, and secure economic prosperity. Each guild operates as a self-governing body, setting its own regulations and hierarchies.

The guilds of Doria represent a diverse range of crafts and vocations, including the esteemed Guild of Arcanists, Guild of Blacksmiths, Guild of Traders, Guild of Scribes, and many others. Membership in these guilds is highly esteemed, offering individuals not only the opportunity for professional growth but also social recognition and access to exclusive networks.

**Honorable Duels and Matriarchal Families:**

Deeply ingrained in the cultural norms of Doria is the practice of honorable dueling. The concept of personal honor is paramount in this society, and conflicts or disputes between individuals are often resolved through ritualistic combat. These duels serve as a means to settle grievances, restore honor, and determine the rightful victor.

Another distinctive aspect of Dorian culture is the prevalence of matriarchal families. Women hold significant influence within these families, assuming the role of decision-makers and arrangers of marriages. Matrons, known as "Matriarchs," play a central role in selecting suitable matches for their children, considering factors such as social standing, compatibility, and strategic alliances. This matriarchal system reflects a balance of power and authority between genders and fosters a strong sense of familial unity and lineage preservation.

**Retaining Cultural Identity as a Nation in Refuge:**

The expatriate population of Dorians, forced to leave their homeland in the wake of The Black Day, has been resolute in preserving their cultural identity as a nation in refuge. Despite their scattered settlements and integration into foreign lands, they steadfastly cling to their customs, traditions, and language, carrying the flame of Dorian heritage wherever they go.

Dorian expatriates form tight-knit communities, creating social enclaves that serve as bastions of their cultural identity. These communities strive to maintain distinct customs, celebrate traditional festivals, and uphold the teachings of their ancestors. Language schools, cultural centers, and communal gatherings become focal points for preserving the Dorian way of life, ensuring that future generations remain connected to their roots.

This tenacious focus on cultural identity is not only a means of preserving the past but also a testament to the unyielding spirit of the Dorians. It serves as a reminder that, despite the shattered remnants of their once-mighty empire, the essence of Doria endures in the hearts and minds of its people, forging an unbreakable bond that transcends time and adversity.

## Caranth: The Chaos of Freedom

![The Caranthian Cityscape](https://gyazo.com/c1c4ffbb87d8ac6a5dc425062c0e0f46)

The land of Carantia, situated at the farthest reaches of the Vardan Empire, has always maintained its distinct culture and unwavering commitment to martial traditions. Its people, known for their warlike nature, hold military prowess and disciplined organization in high regard, prioritizing them above civil liberties. Even their artistic expressions bear the mark of their militant spirit, with towering spires adorned with vivid depictions of drills and triumphant victories.

Following the collapse of the empire, Carantia emerged as a formidable rival to Doria, sparking centuries of intense competition and warfare between the two powers. Their primary battleground became the Dorian vassal of Ruthenia, where their shared border became a constant backdrop of conflict, stained with bloodshed and the clash of steel.

Had it not been for The Black Day, Carantia may have achieved its ambition of conquering Doria and resurrecting the Imperium. However, the fateful battle of Doria witnessed the demise of the entire royal house of Carantia, with the exception of one sole survivor—Rorn, a distant nephew who inherited the weight of the fallen dynasty. Tragically, even his life was abruptly cut short by an assassin's hand, abruptly ending the VarZolen line.

Seizing the opportunity presented by this upheaval, activists and visionaries within Carantia drove the former kingdom toward a new era as a democracy. Over the past three decades, their efforts have borne fruit, resulting in the establishment of a democratic system. However, the transition has not been without challenges. Political factions now vie for influence and power, while the loss of their expert military force has left Carantia in a precarious and vulnerable position, susceptible to external threats.

### Caranthians at a Glance

![Caranthian Workshop with Apprentices](https://gyazo.com/6db873b132ee7721773013f0752bda70)

**By the Sea, by the Air:**

Carantia, situated on a rugged archipelago with towering mountains and breathtaking vistas, boasts a geography as diverse as its cultural heritage. Surrounded by vast seas, the Carantians have long been skilled navigators, mastering both conventional sea vessels and majestic airships that soar through the skies. Their maritime traditions are deeply ingrained in their way of life, and the sight of their ships dotting the horizon is a testament to their prowess.

**A Land of Lands:**

In the wake of the empire's collapse, Carantia experienced a significant transformation, evolving into a confederation of democratic city-states. Each city-state operates autonomously, with its own government, laws, and distinct character. While this confederation system ensures local autonomy, it also fosters a spirit of competition and occasional rivalry between the city-states. Yet, when faced with external threats or challenges, the Carantians have historically shown a remarkable ability to unite and defend their collective interests.

**Legendary Hosts:**

One of the hallmarks of Carantian culture is their legendary hospitality. The Carantians are renowned for their graciousness and warm welcome extended to visitors and guests. It is said that no one leaves Carantia without experiencing their generosity, feasting on sumptuous meals, and enjoying the finest entertainment. This tradition of hospitality is deeply rooted in their society and reflects their values of communal harmony and mutual respect.

**The Great Forge:**

Nestled at the base of a dormant volcano, Carantia is home to magnificent forgeworks that have been honed to perfection over generations. The intense heat and abundant mineral resources provided by the volcanic region have allowed the Carantians to excel in the art of metallurgy and craftsmanship. Skilled blacksmiths and artisans create exquisite weapons, armor, and ornamental pieces that are highly sought after throughout the continent. The glowing furnaces and rhythmic hammering of the forgeworks serve as a testament to Carantia's dedication to the mastery of their craft.
In the face of shifting fortunes and changing political landscapes, Carantia stands as a resilient land, holding onto its militant traditions, maritime legacy, democratic city-states, legendary hospitality, and the resounding clang of hammers shaping metal at the foot of a majestic volcano.

## Ruthenia: The Edge of Oblivion

![Novemgrod, the City of Mist](https://gyazo.com/f144e6d3442d94923fdb2d92452855fb)

Ruthenia was the second land to succumb to Varden's might and an initial partner in the formation of the Empire, boasts a multitude of vibrant and cosmopolitan cities among the Near Lands. Situated between the eastern reaches of Doria and the western expanse of Carantia, Ruthenia has long been a hotly contested region, witnessing centuries of conflict and ever-changing loyalties.

During the War, Ruthenia adeptly played both sides, skillfully maneuvering for increased power and influence. The collective cities of Ruthenia, recognizing their strategic value, sold their mercenary forces to the highest bidder, ensuring that their ancient conquerors remained weakened and incapable of launching successful campaigns against them.

However, the devastating The Black Day and the encroaching Murk took a severe toll on the eastern third of Ruthenia. The region was left in ruins, and many of the once-mighty political dynasties crumbled within a mere five years. Those who survived were thrust into a desperate struggle for stability, as they grappled with the aftermath of the catastrophe. The resilient and fiercely individualistic Ruthen people, known for their resourcefulness, brace themselves for a new era, ever watchful of the potential resurgence of their rival, Carantania.

In the midst of this tumultuous landscape, the metropolitan cities of Ruthenia continue to shine as beacons of culture and progress, their streets teeming with diversity and intellectual pursuits.

**The Ancient and the New:**

Within the borders of Ruthenia, a land steeped in history and diverse influences, one finds a mesmerizing sight: the striking spired architecture that adorns its cities. Many of these architectural marvels pay homage to the original designs of the Vardan Empire, serving as a reminder of the region's glorious past. These towering structures stand as testaments to the architectural prowess and artistic ingenuity of the Ruthen people.

However, despite the grandeur of their cities, Ruthenia is not without its cultural divisions. A distinct gap exists between the rural peasantry, who toil under the vast expanse of the countryside, and the bustling industrial centers that dominate the urban landscapes. The cities are filled with factories, where the noise of machinery reverberates through the streets, creating a stark contrast to the serenity of the rural fields. This divide in lifestyles and aspirations often fuels tensions and a sense of disconnect between the two worlds.

**Serfs and Kings:**

Ruthenia's political structure is characterized by a system where the nobles, known as Korovladi, hold direct ownership of their lands under the rule of the Korvus - King. This hierarchical arrangement shapes the power dynamics within the realm, with the nobles exerting influence and control over their respective territories. The Korvus acts as the central authority, responsible for maintaining order and overseeing the affairs of the kingdom. This delicate balance of power between the monarchy and the noble class often plays a pivotal role in shaping the course of Ruthenia's history.

**The Grey Muses:**

At the heart of Ruthen culture lies the spirit of resilience and endurance. The people are stern and resolute, weathering the trials and tribulations that life throws their way. It is through this perseverance that the Ruthen people produce great works of writing, capturing the essence of their experiences and the soul of their nation. Some notable authors within the Ruthen literary tradition include:

-Ruvana Morozova - Renowned for her introspective and evocative poetry collection, "Whispers of the Frozen Land."
-Aleksander Petrovich - A master of historical fiction, his epic novel "The Chronicles of Rus" chronicles the turbulent events of Ruthen history.
-Natalya Dragunova - Known for her thought-provoking literary essays and insightful social commentary in her book "Reflections of the Silent Steppes."

These authors, among many others, contribute to the rich tapestry of Ruthen literature, capturing the spirit, resilience, and deep-rooted traditions of the Ruthen people. Their works serve as a testament to the enduring cultural legacy that continues to shape the literary landscape of Ruthenia.

## Pytaris

![The Ancient Ruins of Pyta, the old capital](https://gyazo.com/f47a36056712bb04949f03f41c6cf2c6)

Nestled across the towering peaks of the Mavren mountains, Pytharis stands as the cultural nucleus of the Near Lands. With an air of exoticism and a penchant for philosophical pursuits, Pytharis has long been revered as the wellspring of art, culture, and intellectual exploration. While it has never sought dominance, Pytharis has consistently played a vital role as the agricultural powerhouse of Tellus throughout recorded history.

Situated between the ever-rivaling powers of Doria and Turcia, Pytharis has been a coveted economic hub and a hotly contested territory for countless generations. Even during the tumultuous years of the War, Pytharis's attempts at maintaining neutrality proved futile, as armies marched across its lands, planting flags only to be displaced by the opposing forces soon after.

The Black Day, with its devastating effects, spared much of Pytharis from its direct wrath. This fortunate circumstance granted Pytharis a significant advantage in warding off the encroachments of Turcia, resulting in a fragile balance that has held precariously for the past three decades.

### Pytarks at a Glance

![A family in the Pytar countryside](https://cdn.midjourney.com/05195016-a4d4-467e-81dd-5c32c832e69f/0_1.png)

**The silence of Le Vides:**

Pytharis is home to the ancient and revered temples of Le Vides, which were once vibrant centers of spiritual devotion. However, in the wake of The Black Day, these temples have fallen into a mysterious silence, their sacred rites and rituals abandoned. The profound stillness that envelops these sacred sites now hints at a forgotten legacy.

**The Network:**

Renowned for their astute intelligence operations, Pytharis boasts the finest network of spies in all of Tellus. These clandestine operatives, shrouded in secrecy, gather intelligence and disseminate information with unparalleled precision. Whispers of Pytharian spies weaving their web of intrigue echo throughout the realms, their allegiances and motives remaining enigmatic to most.

**The Golden Princes:**

Ruling over Pytharis are a series of merchant princes, each vying for supremacy through the art of economics. These shrewd and cunning individuals manipulate markets, amass wealth, and wield their influence to shape the destiny of Pytharis. The city-state becomes a labyrinthine arena of economic rivalries and power struggles, where fortunes are made and lost in the blink of an eye.

**Songs of Legend:**

The people of Pytharis are renowned for their exceptional skills in dance and entertainment. Gifted with a natural flair for captivating performances, they captivate audiences with their grace, fluidity, and unparalleled artistry. Pytharian dancers and entertainers are highly sought after in noble courts across Tellus, their mesmerizing displays of talent adding a touch of elegance and splendor to grand festivities and celebrations."

## The Lands Beyond the Empire

### Turcia: The Land of Living Gods

![The Bright City of Sahr sees no Conflict with the Old and New](https://cdn.midjourney.com/b51d3ab4-c1c0-49f1-a150-2e21bb94e51f/0_3_384_N.webp)

A land steeped in history, Turcia has seen various forms of governance throughout its existence. From being ruled by nomadic steppe warriors to an empire with a complex social structure, it has evolved over time. In the past five centuries, Turcia has embraced a theocratic system, with a singular figure known as the Golden Lord holding dominion over the land.

The enigmatic presence of the Golden Lord first emerges in written records around the early 470s BBD. Unlike rulers with spouses or successors, the Golden Lord has defied mortality, remaining a solitary figure with no apparent heirs. Revered as a descendant or embodiment of the divine entity Makru, the Golden Lord has ushered in a golden age for Turcia, coinciding with the decline and disappearance of the Vardan Empire. The favor of the gods seems to have bestowed its blessings upon the land of the Turci.

However, unsettling rumors have started to circulate within the court, casting doubt on the fate of the Golden Lord. For over six decades, no written accounts of the Lord have been recorded, fueling speculation that he may be deceased or absent. Despite this uncertainty, Turcia has managed to maintain internal order and even expand its borders during this time. The implications of the Lord's absence or demise remain uncertain, and Pytharis, in the neighboring Far Lands, watches with a sense of cautious optimism, grateful for the respite from potential turmoil. The fate of Turcia hangs in the balance, awaiting the revelation of the truth and the subsequent course of events.

![Turcik families often work within the state together](https://cdn.midjourney.com/106ec9a9-f589-4606-8f72-2532728a5161/0_2.png)

One of the remarkable phenomena in Turcicus is the occurrence of children born with mesmerizing purple eyes. These rare individuals are believed to be blessed by Makru, the deity associated with the Golden Lord. Recognized as a sign of divine favor, these children are sought out by the servants of the Golden Lord, who take them under their wing for special training and tutelage.

Slavery, although legal in Turcicus, carries certain unique aspects that distinguish it from common practices elsewhere. While slaves exist within the society, they possess certain rights that allow them to purchase their own freedom. The ability to buy one's freedom is a recognized path for slaves to regain their autonomy and become free citizens. However, it is important to note that slavery is not hereditary, and the children of slaves do not inherit their parents' enslaved status. Nevertheless, familial debt can lead to the enslavement of a family, emphasizing the interconnectedness of economic and social factors in Turcicus.

In the complex tapestry of beliefs within Turcicus, there exists a cult devoted to the worship of the enigmatic Midnight Lady, regarded by its followers as the counterpart or companion of the Golden Lord. Members of this clandestine group engage in secretive practices, including assassinations and impersonations of officials to manipulate the country's affairs according to their beliefs. The influence exerted by the cult adds a layer of intrigue and unpredictability to the already intricate power dynamics within Turcicus.

Beyond its religious and political intricacies, the Turci people themselves exhibit a distinct and endearing trait of openness and curiosity about the wider world. They eagerly welcome travelers and storytellers, valuing the exchange of knowledge and experiences. The Turci people's genuine interest prompts them to offer hospitality and often compensate individuals for sharing tales and information, further fostering a culture of dialogue and storytelling within their society.

### Suomi

![A Suomi villiage is often only lived in every 4-6 months of the year](https://cdn.midjourney.com/b6870f28-fc7d-4a3b-8a1b-1d952ef41ad9/0_0_384_N.webp)

Deep in the northern reaches of Tellus, where the rugged mountains embrace the eternal snow, resides the resilient and proud Suomi people. Their ancestral roots run deep, and their migratory patterns span the vast taiga, moving from north to south with the changing seasons. Embodying a spirit of freedom and strength, the Suomi have cultivated a warrior culture that permeates every aspect of their lives.

Guided by the Tursakkaanen of Vuorus, their venerable shamans perform sacred rituals, offering bountiful sacrifices of food, goods, and life to the divine forces they revere. Among the Suomi, it is customary for the second-born children to embark on journeys to the south, their inheritance structure intricately linked to the eldest siblings. These brave Suomaran individuals often find themselves serving as elite mercenaries, celebrated in countless bardic tales for their towering stature and unwavering courage.

The Suomi people are organized into eighteen tribes, each led by a Joht (Lord) and Noaidi (Shaman). Together, these thirty-six individuals form the esteemed Althing, a governing body responsible for establishing laws and resolving disputes between the tribes. Within their ranks, the Vuorenuja hold a special status, bestowed upon elder Noaidi who have communed with the gods themselves. Recognized as wise visionaries, they possess the privilege to cast tie-breaking votes during Althing gatherings, ensuring the resolution of important matters.

The Suomi's indomitable spirit, steadfast traditions, and sacred rituals rooted in nature have shaped them into a resilient and honorable people. Their unwavering curiosity and openness to the world have made them eager listeners and passionate conversationalists, often valuing knowledge and information enough to offer generous rewards or extend warm hospitality in exchange for engaging conversations.

![Fishing if often one of best ways to attain food in these cold lands](https://cdn.midjourney.com/7af2537b-7725-4f83-b09c-bff62634f073/0_0_384_N.webp)

Nestled amidst the majestic peaks of Aventhorn, the sacred mountains where the Tursakkaanen reside, lies a pivotal rite of passage for all leaders and heroes of the Suomi people. Aspiring individuals must embark on a treacherous climb, ascending to the heights where the frozen air bites and the gods' presence is palpable. It is here, amidst the icy winds and unforgiving terrain, that visions of the divine may be granted. Those who survive this perilous journey often emerge forever changed, claiming to hear the whispers of their gods directly, a lifelong connection forged in the solitude of the mountain peaks.

Within Suomi society, both men and women share a dedication to physical prowess and endurance. Annually, as the world awakens from the winter's grasp, the Suomi gather for vibrant spring games. These spirited competitions become a testament to their strength and skill, with participants undertaking extraordinary feats to showcase their might. These contests serve not only as demonstrations of physical prowess but also as a celebration of communal unity and shared determination.

The revered Shamans of the Suomi hold a position of great influence and spiritual guidance within the community. Often acting as conduits between the mortal realm and the divine, these wise practitioners may send specific children on extraordinary voyages as commanded by their gods. Endowed with a sacred purpose, these young adventurers embark on journeys of self-discovery, often encountering great trials and revelations. Upon their return, they are met with honor and respect, taking their rightful place as esteemed members of their tribe, entrusted with preserving ancestral wisdom and traditions.

Deeply rooted in a communal ethos, the Suomi extend their hospitality to strangers, offering them shelter and sustenance as a matter of cultural practice. The spirit of brotherhood and unity permeates their gatherings, where great feasts are shared, stories are woven, and bonds are forged. However, it is crucial to note that the Suomi possess a formidable sense of justice, and when wronged, their peaceful demeanor can transform into swift and resolute action, unleashing their innate capacity for violence in defense of what they hold dear.

The Suomi people, marked by their sacred mountain rituals, physical prowess, and deep communal ties, embody a profound connection with their gods and the natural world around them. Their unwavering hospitality is an extension of their belief in the interconnectedness of all beings, fostering an atmosphere of camaraderie and shared experiences that have shaped the Suomi into a resilient and noble society.

### Kemet

Nestled amidst the enigmatic lands of the Black River, Kemet stands as a testament to the ancient heritage that predates the memories of most. Monuments and structures, hallowed by time, bear witness to a glorious past that has influenced and inspired countless empires and kingdoms throughout the ages.

However, the grandeur of bygone eras has slowly waned, and Kemet has experienced a prolonged decline. Once a global powerhouse, it gradually receded into a regional dominion, ultimately becoming an isolated kingdom along the banks of the Black River. A succession of inept and mediocre rulers contributed to this downward trajectory, leading to courtly isolation and a reluctance to embrace technological advancements. These factors left Kemet vulnerable to external influences, casting a shadow over its former glory.

The opportunistic Dorians seized this moment of vulnerability, employing military campaigns and occupying Kemet to establish their control over the court and civil systems. Despite their dominance, they dared not depose the revered Pharaohs, whose sacred status and cultural influence held immense sway over the people. Thus, a delicate balance emerged, with the Dorians reigning over Kemet while cautiously avoiding a mass rebellion.

However, with the fall of Doria, a home to call upon in times of need no longer existed for the people of Kemet. In this critical juncture, a young and ambitious Pharaoh named Shafra-Ab has taken it upon himself to rally his forces and expel the Dorians from their ancestral lands. Sensing the impending threat, the Dorians have tightened their grip, strategically funneling expatriate groups from Doria into the kingdom, in a bid to perpetuate their dominance and preserve their hold on power.

Kemet, once the cradle of ancient wisdom and profound civilization, now finds itself at a crossroads, grappling with the shadows of its past and the uncertainties of its future. The fate of the kingdom hangs in the balance as the Pharaoh Shafra-Ab embarks on a daring quest to reclaim Kemet's sovereignty, while the Dorians endeavor to consolidate their control over a land that teeters on the precipice of change. The echoes of an ancient civilization resound within Kemet, and the unfolding chapters of its history will determine whether it shall rise from the ashes of decline or succumb to the tides of fate.

Within the borders of Kemet, a land steeped in ancient mystique, a brutal apartheid state has taken root, forged by the Dorians' iron fist. The subjugated Kemet populace, who dare to challenge their oppressors, face the dire consequences of death or enslavement. The pervasive system of discrimination casts a dark shadow over the kingdom, perpetuating a cycle of fear and oppression.

Deeply ingrained in the collective consciousness of the Kemet people is their reverence for the Black River, which they perceive as the lifeblood of the earth itself. The river's flowing waters hold immense spiritual significance, symbolizing the eternal connection between the land, its people, and the divine forces that govern their existence. The Black River weaves through their myths, rituals, and daily lives, serving as a source of inspiration and awe.

Scattered across the vast expanse of Kemet are ancient temples, remnants of a time preceding the rise of other kingdoms. These sacred structures, shrouded in enigma and laced with curses, stand as testaments to a forgotten era. These sites of worship, abandoned by gods and haunted by the spirits of bygone civilizations, serve as a stark reminder of the profound mysteries and deep history that permeate the land.

In spite of their own hardships and destitution, the people of Kemet embody a spirit of generosity and hospitality. Rooted in customs that span thousands of years, they offer what little they possess to those in need, embodying the enduring principles of their ancient culture. However, this noble virtue can occasionally lead to misunderstandings and conflicts, as certain habits or remarks may inadvertently offend their sensibilities, causing tensions to arise.

Within the tapestry of Kemet's existence, a complex interplay of suffering, resilience, and ancient customs unfolds. The apartheid state inflicted by the Dorians casts a shadow over the land, while the people draw strength from their reverence for the Black River and navigate the remnants of long-forgotten temples. The spirit of generosity, despite the hardships faced, remains a guiding principle, even as cultural sensitivities and ancient customs shape the interactions and dynamics within Kemet. The destiny of this ancient kingdom, with its deep-rooted traditions and turbulent history, hangs in the balance as the struggle for liberation and cultural preservation continues to unfold.

### Beithar

In the distant northeast reaches of Tellus, sprawling across vast flat plains, the proud Yoruba people make their home. Guided by the ebb and flow of their nomadic lifestyle, they traverse the open grasslands with their majestic herds of horses, seeking fertile pastures and new horizons. The Yoruba suB Continent extends its influence to the neighboring lands that border the remnants of old Doria and the resolute Suomi. These lands have witnessed the Yoruba's alternating fortunes, as rival powers seize the opportunities when the Yoruba are divided and suffer the consequences when they reunite under a formidable Tarkhan.

This age-old cycle of dominance and unity has persisted for thousands of years. A Tarkhan emerges, leading the Yoruba tribes to conquest and territorial expansion, while the border towns serve as living testament to the cyclical nature of Yoruban dominance. Their customs, traits, and even language blend seamlessly with Yoruba culture. The swift act of kneeling in reverence and submission to a newly proclaimed Tarkhan carries profound meaning, symbolizing the acknowledgment of an unstoppable force that will lay waste to all obstacles in its path.

For centuries, the empire played a delicate game of manipulation and appeasement with the Yoruba hordes, seeking to avoid direct conflict and instead offering incentives to maintain a semblance of stability. However, with the dissolution of the empire and the rise of the charismatic Yoruban prince, Bataar, the tides of fate have cast an unseen die. The fate of the Yoruba and their role in shaping the future of Tellusnow hangs in the balance. Should Bataar successfully rally the fragmented tribes and unite their collective strength, the Yoruba will emerge as the most formidable force in the realm, potentially heralding a new era of Yoruban ascendancy and reshaping the political landscape of Tellus.

Deep within the cultural tapestry of the Yoruba people, a profound tradition known as "memory songs" weaves the threads of their collective memory. Through the magical power of singing, the Yoruba possess the ability to transfer memories and wisdom across generations. Elder members of the community utilize their melodic voices to imbue their stories, experiences, and knowledge into the minds of the younger ones. This ancient practice serves as a bridge connecting the past with the present, preserving the ancestral heritage and ensuring that the lessons of their forebears are carried forward.

From a tender age, the Yoruba children are initiated into the art of horsemanship and the intricacies of working from the backs of their majestic Steppe Rams. These imposing creatures, adorned with magnificent horns, hold a place of utmost significance in Yoruba culture. They provide not only transportation and labor but also a deep spiritual connection between the Yoruba and the land they traverse. The symbiotic relationship between the Yoruba and their Steppe Rams is nurtured through a bond built on trust, respect, and mutual reliance.

In the realm of warfare and hunting, the Yoruba display their prowess with the atlatl—a hooked implement utilized to propel javelins across vast distances, sometimes exceeding hundreds of yards. This ancient projectile weapon, honed to perfection by generations of Yoruban warriors, serves as a testament to their precision and skill. While the Yoruba have embraced firearms in their interactions with outsiders, their traditional weapons, including the atlatl, remain the preferred choice when engaging in battles or pursuing their traditional way of life.

Integrity and honesty are held in the highest regard among the Yoruba, for their legends recount the dire consequences awaiting those who engage in deception. Their moral compass is rooted in a profound belief in justice and the afterlife, where deceptive souls are destined to face terrible punishments. This cultural ethos of unflinching honesty permeates the fabric of Yoruban society, shaping their interactions and engendering trust and transparency among their people.

The Yoruba, with their time-honored memory songs, mastery of horsemanship, prowess in ancient weaponry, and unwavering commitment to truth, stand as a formidable force, both revered and respected within the realm of Tellus. Their rich cultural heritage and unyielding principles continue to guide them, as they navigate the ever-shifting tides of history and strive to shape their own destiny in the vast expanse of the world.

# The Great War and the Black Day

The Great War erupted with a cataclysmic clash between the formidable nations of Doria and Carantia. Tensions between the two had simmered for years, fueled by territorial disputes, political maneuvering, and a deep-rooted sense of national pride. The spark that ignited the powder keg came in the form of an assassination, an act that would forever alter the course of history.

As the war unfolded, Ruthenia and Hellas found themselves on the sidelines, initially maintaining a stance of neutrality. Ruthenia, a nation known for its fertile lands and agricultural prowess, sought to shield its resources from the ravages of war. Hellas, embroiled in its own bitter conflict with the expansionist nation of Turcicus, had its attention divided, grappling with the pressures of defending its borders and preserving its sovereignty.

The cunning strategists of Doria recognized an opportunity to tip the scales in their favor. By declaring war on Turcicus, they enticed Hellas into joining their cause. Hellas, burdened by the ongoing hostilities with Turcicus and enticed by the promises of favorable post-war agreements, reluctantly acquiesced to Doria's call for aid. The once-neutral Hellas was thrust into the maelstrom of war, its fate irrevocably intertwined with that of Doria.

Carantia, its princes driven by its thirst for dominion, sought to expand its influence and reshape the geopolitical landscape. Recognizing the vulnerability of Ruthenia, Carantia employed coercive tactics to force its involvement in the war. They threatened to sever the vital trade routes that sustained Ruthenia's food stores, unleashing the specter of famine upon the nation. Ruthenia, faced with the dire choice between submission or starvation, reluctantly succumbed to Carantia's demands, becoming embroiled in the conflict against its will.

Years of ruinous warfare ensued, marked by a relentless cycle of destruction and despair. Both Doria and Carantia, fueled by their belief in their own righteousness and the desire to dominate their adversaries, unleashed the full force of their military and technological might. It was during this time that the concept of Esoteria emerged as a potent weapon.

Esoteria, the fusion of industrial innovation and arcane magic, represented a revolutionary advancement in the art of war. Scholars, engineers, and magicians collaborated to develop a new breed of devastating weaponry. Enchanted artillery shells obliterated entire battalions, armored constructs bolstered the frontlines, and protective barriers defied conventional assault. The harnessing of magic in conjunction with industrial machinery brought forth unprecedented levels of destruction and loss.

However, amidst the grim stalemate and the horrors of trench warfare, a breakthrough came in the form of airborne warfare. Airships, colossal vessels propelled by enchanted engines and armed with potent weaponry, soared above the desolate battlefields. These floating behemoths defied the constraints of the land and provided a means to bypass the entrenched defenses.

The introduction of airships heralded a new era of warfare. Rapid advancements in aerial technology allowed for strategic bombardments, swift troop deployments, and unprecedented mobility. The war-torn skies became a theater of high-stakes battles, with daring pilots and crews engaged in deadly dogfights, dropping devastating payloads upon enemy positions.

The culmination of these advancements and strategic maneuvers led to the fateful Siege of Varranthal, a pivotal event that would forever change the course of the war. The city of Varranthal, a symbol of power and strategic importance, became the focal point of a relentless assault. Both sides poured vast resources and unleashed the full potential of Esoteria in a desperate bid to secure victory.

It was on "The Black Day," the climax of the siege, that an unimaginable catastrophe occurred. Something went awry, shrouding the city of Varranthal in a malevolent force known as the Murk. The Murk manifested as an otherworldly phenomenon, devouring everything in its path and leaving only desolation in its wake. The city, its inhabitants, and the armies locked in combat were consumed by this enigmatic darkness.

The Murk, an ever-expanding abyss devoid of life, proved inscrutable and implacable. Despite extensive investigations and attempts to discern its nature, no bones, remains, or tangible evidence of the vanished souls were ever recovered. The Murk became an enduring enigma, a haunting reminder of the unspeakable tragedy that unfolded on that ominous day.

In the aftermath of the cataclysm, the shattered nations were left reeling, their populations decimated, and their once-proud cities reduced to mere ruins. The Black Day marked the definitive end of the Great War, not through a decisive victory, but through the collective realization of the irreparable devastation wrought upon Tellus. Leaders, generals, and soldiers perished in the Murk, their ambitions and dreams forever extinguished.

The world emerged from the crucible of war forever scarred, its nations forever changed. The Great War and the Black Day became indelible chapters in history, serving as a somber reminder of the catastrophic consequences of unchecked conflict, the dangers of escalating technology, and the relentless pursuit of power. The scars of the past would shape the future, as the survivors grappled with the challenges of reconstruction, healing, and the ever-present specter of the Murk that loomed as a reminder of the price paid for their hubris.

## The Charred One

**Creeds**

- All shall be consumed by fire, but the last shall be the arsonists.

- Death is not to be feared but embraced; it is a gift granted to the weak, an escape from the dying world.

- Destruction holds an inherent beauty, an exquisite form of expression.

\*\*Holy Days

- The Red Day - May 6th: Commemorating the anniversary of the devastating Gavo firestorm and the birth of their god.

- Herald's Day - August 31st: Observing the anniversary of The Black Day, a significant event in their history.

- The period between The Red Day and Herald's Day is known as Brenndauer, a time when the followers of the Charred One are called to be most active, stoking the flames of their mad pursuit.

No grand temples stand in honor of the Charred One, nor do intentional monuments proclaim their existence. Their monuments are the scorched remnants of cities, and their temples lie within the ruins left by others. In the aftermath of the Great War, those who survived faced a choice: to rebuild or to revel in the ashes of what once stood.

The birth of the Charred One came from the desolation of Gavo, a city ravaged by a cataclysmic firestorm in the year 3 BBD. It emerged silently, calling out to those filled with grief, trauma, and madness.

Followers of the Charred One encounter no tolerance for their beliefs within established cities or towns. Instead, they gather in abandoned places, congregating in the shadows before spreading to the farthest reaches of Tellus to fulfill the will of their deranged deity.

The Charred believe in the ultimate unmaking of all creation, and they employ any means necessary to bring about its destruction. Through manipulation, intrigue, assassination, and incitement of unrest, they seek to ignite the world in chaos. They take particular pleasure in obliterating ancient structures and monuments, for in their destruction, not only the present is ruined but also all potential futures are erased.

### The Burning Congregation

Followers of the Charred One operate in a clandestine and covert manner, reminiscent of terroristic cells or cults. They are driven by their dark devotion to destruction, chaos, and the ultimate annihilation of all creation. Their actions are marked by ruthlessness, secrecy, and a willingness to employ any means necessary to further their cause.

Acting as agents of terror, the followers of the Charred One execute acts of violence, sabotage, and manipulation to sow fear and chaos within society. They target symbols of stability, authority, and ancient structures, relishing in the destruction that erases not only the present but also all potential futures. Their acts range from arson and assassination to incitement of unrest and manipulation of power dynamics.

Recruitment of new members is a delicate and secretive process. The followers of the Charred One seek out individuals who exhibit signs of grief, trauma, and madness, drawing them towards the allure of the destructive deity. They identify those disillusioned with the established order, seeking purpose and an outlet for their deep-seated pain. Through subtle manipulation, the followers gradually expose these individuals to the ideologies and rituals of the Charred One, enticing them with promises of power, release from fear, and the ecstasy of destruction.

Recruitment efforts primarily occur in abandoned places and hidden gatherings, away from the prying eyes of society. Potential recruits are approached individually, tested for their resilience, and gradually introduced to the twisted beliefs and practices of the cult. The followers of the Charred One exploit their vulnerabilities, amplifying their fears and anguishes, ultimately offering them a sense of purpose and belonging within the cult's dark embrace.

The recruitment process involves indoctrination through rituals, rites, and teachings that reinforce the notions of destruction, chaos, and the beauty found in annihilation. New members are gradually initiated into the cult's inner circle, where they are assigned mentors to guide them in the dark arts, imparting knowledge of fire manipulation, subterfuge, and the secrets of the Charred One's doctrines.

Trust and loyalty are paramount among the followers, as betrayal is met with severe consequences. The cult operates with strict secrecy, ensuring that their activities remain hidden from the eyes of authority. Members communicate through encrypted channels and secret symbols, using coded language to avoid detection. This secretive nature ensures that the followers remain elusive, striking fear into the hearts of those who would stand against them.

They serve as the muscle and enforcers within the cells, ensuring obedience and punishing any signs of wavering loyalty.

**Flamebound:**
The Flamebound are the lowest ranks of the Charred One's followers. They have recently joined the cult and have yet to undergo significant transformations. However, their devotion to the Charred One is unquestionable, and they strive to prove their loyalty and ascend the ranks. Flamebound are tasked with gathering information, reconnaissance, and recruitment of potential followers. They are the entry point into the cult-like cells and are closely monitored by higher-ranking members.

### Sins

**Betrayal of Secrets:** Revealing the hidden rituals, doctrines, or identities of fellow cult members or the inner workings of the Charred One's operations to outsiders is considered a grave transgression. It undermines the cult's secrecy and puts its members at risk.

**Failure to Execute Destructive Acts:** Followers of the Charred One are expected to actively contribute to the cause of destruction and chaos. Failing to carry out assigned acts of violence, sabotage, or manipulation is seen as a betrayal of their commitment to the deity and his teachings.

**Sympathy for Preservation:** Showing empathy or compassion towards the preservation of life, stability, or ancient structures contradicts the fundamental beliefs of the cult. Any expression of sentiment or reluctance towards embracing the annihilation and eradication advocated by the Charred One is seen as a serious transgression.

**Disobedience to Superiors:** Defying the commands or orders given by higher-ranking members within the cult hierarchy is considered a transgression. The followers of the Charred One operate with a strict chain of command, and any act of disobedience disrupts the unity and effectiveness of their destructive efforts.

**Collaboration with Opposing Forces:** Engaging in alliances, collaborations, or cooperations with individuals or groups that are actively opposing or obstructing the goals of the Charred One is seen as a betrayal. The cult expects absolute loyalty and allegiance to its cause, leaving no room for compromise or cooperation with those who stand against them.

**Doubt or Questioning:** Expressing doubt or questioning the teachings, ideologies, or actions of the Charred One is viewed as a transgression against the cult's core beliefs. Followers are expected to have unwavering faith and conviction in the path of destruction and chaos set forth by their deity.

**Failure to Initiate New Recruits:** Each member of the cult is entrusted with the task of recruiting and expanding their ranks. Failing to actively seek out and initiate new followers is considered a transgression. It hinders the growth and influence of the cult, impeding its ability to further the cause of destruction and spread chaos.

**Revealing Personal Weaknesses:** Sharing personal vulnerabilities or weaknesses with outsiders or fellow cult members is seen as a transgression against the cult's ethos. Followers are expected to present a unified front, projecting strength, and embracing the power that comes from the destruction they seek.

### Atonement

Atonement for transgressions within the cult of the Charred One is a complex and arduous process, as the deity and his followers embrace destruction and chaos rather than traditional notions of repentance. However, there are some ways in which a follower can seek to regain favor and mitigate the consequences of their transgressions:

**Offering Greater Destruction:** One way to atone is to demonstrate an intensified commitment to the cause of destruction and chaos. The follower must engage in acts of unparalleled devastation, surpassing their previous actions and proving their dedication to the Charred One's principles. By causing widespread mayhem and furthering the cult's goals, they can strive to redeem themselves.

**Sacrificial Rituals:** Followers can partake in sacrificial rituals where they offer something significant to appease the Charred One and seek forgiveness. This might involve sacrificing a cherished possession, enduring physical pain, or even offering the lives of others to demonstrate their devotion and willingness to make amends.

**Undertaking a Trial by Fire:** A follower seeking atonement may undergo a trial by fire, a grueling test of their loyalty and commitment. This could involve enduring physical or psychological challenges, walking through flames, or subjecting themselves to extreme environments or situations associated with fire and destruction. Success in the trial signifies purification and potential forgiveness.

**Completing a Mission of Destruction:** The follower can be assigned a specific mission or task by the cult's leadership, designed to showcase their renewed dedication and loyalty. By successfully executing this mission, causing significant destruction or sowing chaos, they can demonstrate their remorse and willingness to make amends for their transgressions.

**Reaffirming Allegiance through Rituals:** Participating in intense and elaborate rituals can serve as acts of atonement. These rituals may involve self-flagellation, enduring pain or hardship, or engaging in acts symbolizing destruction and rebirth. Through these rituals, the follower reinforces their commitment to the Charred One and seeks purification from their past failures.

It's important to note that forgiveness within the cult of the Charred One is not easily granted. Atonement is a demanding and ongoing process that requires extreme dedication, unwavering loyalty, and a continuous pursuit of destruction. Even if a follower manages to atone for their transgressions, the memory of their past actions may linger, and they may always be viewed with caution and scrutiny by their fellow cult members.

## The Tursakkaanen

**Creeds**

- The world is indifferent, neither cruel nor wonderful. It simply exists, as do we.

- As humans, we are beings designed to experience. We are rewarded with pleasure and punished with pain.

- The wind carries no bias; it is driven by the currents of the world.

**Holy Days**

- Red Sunsets: A sacred phenomenon for the Listeners, during which they may hear the whispers of their gods.

- Long Twilight - December: In the Northern regions, this time of year is enveloped in near-constant darkness. It becomes an opportunity for the holy men to ascend the Mountain and attain new wisdom while their gods awaken.

Far to the North, the Tursakkaanen observe the world from their perch atop Mount Avrenthorn. They uphold an ancient system of laws and rituals passed down by the shamans and holy seers of the icy steppe.

While they do not actively interfere in the affairs of mankind, they exert influence upon those who are willing to listen to their timeless wisdom. Pilgrims who embark upon the arduous journey to the summit of the towering mountains may experience the resounding voices of the Nine echoing within their minds. The words are spoken slowly, spanning years to complete.

The followers of the Tursakkaanen, known as the Listeners, choose to surrender themselves to the currents of fate and the guidance of their own thoughts. They extend their consciousness beyond the present moment, immersing themselves in the ancient chants and sacred utterances of their deities. This communion allows them to become vessels of fate. A Listener often finds themselves in precisely the right place at the right time, although they may endure suffering as a consequence of their serendipity.

The Listeners are generally welcomed but met with some distrust among people from various corners of the world. Their tendency to also embody the roles of vagabonds, thieves, or humble individuals relegates them to the lower echelons of society within urban areas.

### The Listeners

The followers of the Tursakkaanen, known as the Listeners, operate with a sense of purpose and devotion deeply rooted in their guiding principles. They perceive the world as an indifferent entity and believe in surrendering themselves to the currents of fate. The Listeners act with a certain level of detachment, recognizing that pleasure and pain are inherent aspects of human existence.

The Listeners lead a nomadic lifestyle, wandering through various lands and rarely gathering outside of Suomi Lands. They can often be seen working closely with tribal leaders in the northern regions, forging alliances and offering their unique insights. However, in other parts of the world, the Listeners may appear as vagabonds, blending into the lower echelons of society.

Recruitment of new members into the Tursakkaanen is an organic process driven by personal experiences and revelations. Potential recruits are often individuals who have shown a proclivity for seeking deeper truths and contemplating the workings of the world. They may encounter Listeners during their own journeys or chance encounters, where the Listeners share their timeless wisdom and insights. Those who resonate with the philosophy and beliefs of the Tursakkaanen may choose to join their ranks voluntarily.

The Listeners value introspection and self-discovery, encouraging new members to embark on personal quests and pilgrimages to gain a deeper understanding of themselves and the world. They believe in the power of experience and direct revelation, as well as the resounding voices of the Nine that echo within the minds of the faithful. Listeners may guide and mentor new members, helping them navigate the complexities of their newfound spiritual path.

The Listeners prioritize the preservation of their ancient laws, rituals, and wisdom. They rely on oral traditions and sacred chants passed down through generations, keeping their beliefs alive through the recitation of ancient texts and the performance of rituals. Listeners engage in deep communion with their deities, seeking guidance and enlightenment from the voices that resonate within them.

Overall, the Listeners operate with a sense of humility, embracing their role as vessels of fate. They strive to live in harmony with the world and its natural rhythms, while offering their wisdom and guidance to those who are open to receiving it. The actions of the Listeners are guided by their unique understanding of the interconnectedness of fate, power, cold, life, and death, and their desire to navigate the currents of existence with grace and insight.

### The 5 Ranks of Nine

**Elder Seers:** The Elder Seers are the highest-ranking individuals within the Tursakkaanen hierarchy.

Elder Seers are revered as the ultimate authorities and spiritual leaders among the Listeners.

**Tribal Liaisons:** These are Listeners who have earned the trust and respect of the tribal leaders in the northern regions where the Tursakkaanen frequently operate. They act as intermediaries between the Listeners and the tribal communities, facilitating cooperation and mutual understanding.

**Sacred Scribes:** The Sacred Scribes are skilled individuals among the Listeners who possess the ability to transcribe and interpret the sacred chants, rituals, and prophecies of the Tursakkaanen. They meticulously record the ancient wisdom bestowed upon them by the Nine and ensure the preservation of their sacred texts. Sacred Scribes play a crucial role in maintaining the collective knowledge and spiritual traditions of the Listeners.

**Ritual Guardians:** Ritual Guardians are entrusted with the responsibility of safeguarding the sacred rituals, artifacts, and places of worship of the Tursakkaanen.

**Seekers of Fate:** Seekers of Fate are Listeners who have embarked on a personal journey of self-discovery and enlightenment. They undertake arduous quests and pilgrimages to distant lands, seeking to expand their understanding of the world and strengthen their connection with the Nine. Seekers of Fate often bear distinctive ritualistic tattoos, each with a unique name symbolizing their personal quest or revelation. These tattoos serve as marks of distinction and recognition within the hierarchy.

It is worth noting that the hierarchy within the Tursakkaanen is fluid and flexible due to their wandering nature and decentralized structure. Authority and influence are often earned through wisdom, experience, and the respect garnered from both the Listeners themselves and the tribal communities with whom they interact. The ritualistic tattoos carried by the Seekers of Fate serve as visual indicators of their station and accomplishments within the hierarchy, symbolizing their spiritual growth and journey toward enlightenment.

A follower who intentionally disrupts or disrespects these ceremonies, whether through interruption, mockery, or inappropriate behavior, commits a transgression that dishonors the traditions and beliefs of the Tursakkaanen.

**Failing to Uphold the Values of Serenity and Detachment:** The Tursakkaanen believe in embracing the world with serenity and accepting the currents of fate. A follower who consistently acts with anger, aggression, or seeks personal gain at the expense of others violates the values of the Tursakkaanen and commits a transgression against the peaceful and detached nature they strive to embody.

It is important to note that the Tursakkaanen view transgressions as opportunities for growth and redemption. They believe in the power of self-reflection, repentance, and seeking forgiveness from the Nine and the community of Listeners.

They ensure the quality and dedication of the choir's musical performances, inspiring the faithful with their melodic expressions of devotion. Choir Masters also play a role in organizing special choral performances during significant holy days and celebrations.

**Reclaimer:** As the militant wing of The Penitent Choir, the Reclaimers have the responsibility of protecting refugees, the poor, and the marginalized. They function as a humanitarian and defense force, providing shelter, aid, and security to those in need. Reclaimers embody the principles of justice, compassion, and unity through their actions, standing as defenders of the weak and champions of social justice.

**Ordained Ministers:** Ordained Ministers are individuals who have undergone rigorous training and study of The Penitent Choir's teachings. They serve as spiritual guides, counselors, and facilitators of religious ceremonies within local communities. Ordained Ministers lead congregations in prayers, provide pastoral care, and assist in organizing and conducting the various holy day observances and rituals.

**Faithful Followers:** The body of The Penitent Choir consists of dedicated and faithful followers who actively participate in the church's activities, rituals, and charitable endeavors. They are encouraged to engage in acts of selfless service, altruism, and compassionate outreach to embody the teachings of their faith. The faithful engage in daily singing sessions, attend gatherings and sermons, and contribute to the betterment of society through their individual and collective efforts.

This hierarchical structure of The Penitent Choir reflects the balance between spiritual leadership, guidance, community organization, and the pursuit of altruistic acts as a means of bringing about redemption and renewal. It allows for the fulfillment of the faith's core tenets while maintaining a harmonious relationship between the followers, their leaders, and the divine purpose they strive to fulfill.

#### Sins

While The Penitent Choir promotes a path of redemption and compassion, there are certain transgressions that a follower could make against the god and the principles of the faith. These transgressions include:

**Betrayal:** Betraying the trust of fellow followers or the community by engaging in actions that harm or deceive others goes against the core principles of unity and compassion.

**Injustice:** Actively promoting or participating in acts of injustice, such as discrimination, oppression, or exploitation, contradicts the belief in justice and fairness upheld by The Penitent Choir.

**Selfishness:** Prioritizing one's own interests and desires over the well-being and needs of others runs counter to the values of compassion and selflessness emphasized by the faith.

**Cruelty:** Engaging in deliberate acts of cruelty, violence, or harm towards fellow beings, whether human or non-human, goes against the principles of compassion and redemption.

**Abandoning Responsibilities:** Neglecting or abandoning the duties and responsibilities entrusted to a follower within the community, such as failing to provide assistance or support to those in need, can be seen as a transgression against the tenets of The Penitent Choir.

**Lack of Forgiveness:** Holding grudges, refusing to forgive, or harboring feelings of resentment and vengeance towards others contradicts the spirit of redemption, unity, and compassion promoted by the faith.

**Falsehood:** Engaging in dishonesty, spreading falsehoods, or manipulating others for personal gain undermines the values of truthfulness and integrity upheld by The Penitent Choir.

**Greed:** Excessive desire for wealth, possessions, or power, at the expense of others or without considering the needs of the marginalized, stands in contrast to the principles of selflessness and justice.

It's important to note that The Penitent Choir believes in the possibility of redemption and offers avenues for atonement and growth. Followers who commit transgressions can seek forgiveness, engage in acts of repentance, and work towards making amends to restore harmony within themselves and the community.

###Atonement

A follower of The Penitent Choir can seek atonement for their transgressions through various means, guided by the principles of redemption, unity, compassion, and justice. Here are some ways in which a follower can seek atonement:

**Acknowledgment and Confession:** The first step towards atonement is acknowledging and taking responsibility for one's transgressions. Followers are encouraged to reflect upon their actions, recognize the harm caused, and openly confess their mistakes to those affected or to the community as a whole.
Repentance and Contrition: Genuine remorse and a sincere desire to change are essential for atonement. A follower must express heartfelt regret for their actions, demonstrating a willingness to learn from their mistakes and make amends.

**Acts of Restitution:** Atonement often involves making restitution or reparations for the harm caused. This may include seeking forgiveness from those affected, offering apologies, and taking practical steps to rectify the damage done, both in material and emotional terms.

**Self-Reflection and Transformation:** Followers are encouraged to engage in self-reflection and introspection to understand the root causes of their transgressions. By identifying underlying issues or negative patterns, they can work towards personal growth, cultivating virtues such as empathy, compassion, and humility.

**Service and Altruism:** Engaging in acts of service and selflessness is a fundamental part of atonement within The Penitent Choir. By actively participating in charitable deeds, supporting the marginalized, and working towards justice and social change, followers demonstrate their commitment to making a positive impact in the world.

Seeking Guidance and Mentorship: A follower may seek guidance from spiritual leaders, elders, or mentors within the community. These individuals can provide counsel, support, and guidance on the path of atonement, helping the follower navigate their journey towards redemption.

**Continued Devotion and Practice:** Atonement is an ongoing process that requires dedication and perseverance. Followers are encouraged to deepen their spiritual practice, engage in regular prayer, meditation, and acts of worship, allowing their faith to guide their actions and decisions.

It's important to note that atonement within The Penitent Choir is not a mere ritual or external act but a deeply personal and transformative journey. The process of atonement involves sincere internal reflection, genuine remorse, and active efforts towards positive change, both individually and within the community.

# Esoteria

An aspiring Magister or novice Esoteria practitioner is a scholar of the arcane arts. Through the meticulous study of formulas, the utilization of reagents, and the strength of their determination, they tap into invisible and intangible forces that hold true existence. By drawing upon these forces and channeling them into the realm of Tellus, they become conduits, shaping and manipulating them to suit their desires. This power they wield bears resemblance to the divine power harnessed by the Gods themselves, thus highlighting the perpetual tension between the devout followers and those who question the necessity of divine entities in the world.

## Daemons and Others

Magisters of all bents and talents often find it useful to conjure up Daemons to do their bidding. These beings are not brought from another plane to our knowledge, but are conjured straight from the mind of the Magister, taking on the form and temperment chosen at the time of creation.

That is not to say that all Daemons are just husks bound to their Magister's will. In fact the more potent the summoned Daemon, the greater the struggle to maintain control. Daemons of sufficient strength do break free from their masters, living strange lives in forms of their alteration, for unknown periods of time before dissappating.

# Novemgrod, Setting the Stage

The Mist Cliffs of Novemgrod stand as a testament to the resilience and ingenuity of its inhabitants. Situated on the western edge of the Eastern Shelf, this once-thriving city found itself on the precipice of oblivion when the Murk engulfed its surroundings, leaving only two sides exposed to the enigmatic mist. In the wake of such a devastating catastrophe, the survival of Novemgrod hinged upon the unwavering dedication of the builder's guilds.

Faced with the imminent threat of dissolution, the skilled craftsmen and women of Novemgrod's builder's guilds rallied together, laboring tirelessly for weeks on end. Their collective efforts were focused on salvaging what remained of the city, fortifying its structures, and shoring up the foundations against the encroaching mist. It was through their unwavering determination and unwavering spirit that Novemgrod managed to withstand the relentless onslaught of the Murk, emerging as a beacon of hope amidst the chaos.

While the city may have lost many of its historical quarters to the relentless advance of the mist, fragments of its glorious past still linger. Among the remnants, the legendary Palatine Regium, an ancient stronghold and castle dating back to the bygone era of the Imperium, stands as a proud testament to Novemgrod's storied history. This architectural marvel, though weathered by time and the encroaching mist, stands as a poignant symbol of the city's enduring spirit.

The transformation brought about by the Murktide has given rise to a unique and awe-inspiring architectural landscape within Novemgrod. The clash between the absurdist architecture, born out of necessity and the urgency of rebuilding, and the few remaining ancient spires creates a surreal juxtaposition. The cityscape becomes a tapestry of grandiose impressions and resolute desperation, where the ingenuity of the builders merges with the echoes of a glorious past.

The shifting nature of the Murktide imposes a constant challenge upon the inhabitants of Novemgrod. As the mist ebbs and flows, several teams of dedicated workers swiftly move to fortify and reinforce the foundations of the western plazas. Their tireless efforts, undertaken with a sense of urgency and purpose, are essential in safeguarding the city against the relentless onslaught of the encroaching mist. With each shift of the Murktide, the fate of Novemgrod hangs in the balance, and the resilience of its people is put to the test.

In the face of adversity, Novemgrod stands as a testament to the indomitable human spirit and the unwavering determination to forge a future amidst the encroaching darkness. The Mist Cliffs, with their mixture of survivalist architecture and ancient remnants, serve as a haunting reminder of the fragility of existence and the relentless march of time. Yet, within the mist-shrouded city, a glimmer of hope persists, as the people of Novemgrod continue to defy the odds and write their own tale of resilience and survival in the shadow of the Murk.

## Nobles, Bereft of Nobility

Destined to be an unlikely ruler, Ruvan's path to becoming the Grand Prince was fraught with challenges and disapproval. His own uncle, Milov, held disdain for him throughout his life, belittling him with harsh words of being too soft and ignorant of the world. These disparaging remarks echoed in Ruvan's ears during his formative years, a constant reminder of his perceived inadequacies.

The shadow of comparison loomed over Ruvan, particularly in relation to his cousin Rikov, a valiant prince known for his prowess in battle. Rikov, two years Ruvan's senior, possessed the qualities of bravery and physical prowess that were esteemed in their society. While the two shared a genuine friendship outside the confines of court, Rikov never truly grasped the depths of Ruvan's bookish and delicate nature. As fate would have it, Ruvan's path seemed destined for a life of administration, a role befitting his scholarly inclinations.

However, the onset of The War changed everything. Milov and Rikov departed Novemgrod, leaving Ruvan to govern in their absence as they rallied their armies and Magisters to confront the impending threat from the West. Tragically, they never returned, leaving Ruvan to inherit a shattered homeland and the weighty responsibility of rebuilding in the shadow of his heroic family.

Despite his youth, Ruvan proved to be a wise and discerning ruler. Surrounded by knowledgeable advisors, he exhibited a disregard for the corrupt machinations of the Councils, instead prioritizing the welfare of his subjects. In essence, he embodied the ideals of an enlightened despot, although at times, his determination and inclination towards micromanagement led him down a path of stubbornness. Trusting only a select few among his fellow nobles, Ruvan maintained a cautious proximity to them, aware that a palace coup could be brewing at any moment. While he appeared physically frail, his gaze betrayed a profound insight that seemed to transcend the mortal realm.

In times of need, Ruvan sought the counsel of High Magister Valeska, a relationship built on politeness and friendship. Their interactions served a mutual purpose: the Magister relied on Ruvan for survival, while he sought her guidance in matters of esoteric knowledge. Perhaps something deeper existed between them, a connection that surpassed their respective stations, but the constraints of their roles prevented any further union. Nonetheless, they conversed as kindred spirits, individuals left behind by their more formidable and foolish predecessors, navigating a world that demanded their wisdom and resilience.

## The Cries of Salvation

The echoes of diverse faiths resound through the bustling streets of Novemgrod, a metropolitan center within a larger cosmopolitan region. Within this vibrant tapestry of beliefs, different religions coexist and collaborate while simultaneously engaging in a constant competition for the souls of the populace. It is important to note that these overlapping faiths do not necessarily exclude one another, and grand acts of charity, benevolence, and even "miracles" performed by rival clergy are not uncommon occurrences, each seeking to capture the attention and devotion of the masses.

Generally speaking, the interfaith rivalry remains peaceful, though not always entirely fair. Instances where a miracle is thwarted by a servant of a competing faith may elicit indignation and scorn, yet rarely does this verbal conflict escalate into physical violence. However, an exception to this norm exists in the form of secretive cults that emerge to worship and draw power from the enigmatic Murk and its enigmatic inhabitants. Whispers of nocturnal rituals at the edge of the city persist, though the identities of those involved are veiled in mystery. Furthermore, certain gods are deemed unwelcome in the light of day, such as the ominous Charred One and the enigmatic Apatur. Despite lacking an overt following on paper, intrigue and suffering continue to afflict the city, leaving a lingering sense of unease.

With the exception of the aforementioned cases, the majority of faiths denounce The Murk and its creators, the Magisters. Prior to The War, religious leaders perceived themselves as the sole guardians against the growing power of the Magisters and their imposing Spires. They criticized those who dabbled in Esoteria, viewing their practices as audacious attempts to breach the divine realm and attain godhood themselves.

The calamitous downfall of the Magisters and the subsequent Cataclysm only served to validate the concerns of the faiths. As a result, anyone practicing Esoteria is often met with censure within religious circles, if not outright excommunication, rendering them social outcasts. It is only due to the Magisters' indispensable role in maintaining the vast sea of mist that envelops the city that they have been spared from the torches of religious fervor thus far, for their continued involvement remains a necessity, albeit a begrudging one.

## Towers and Magisters

Perched upon the smoldering remnants of a city she once cherished in her youth, High Magister Valeska II finds herself entangled in a web of complex emotions and daunting responsibilities. Born into poverty as the daughter of a humble practitioner of rudimentary Esoteria, Valeska embarked on a relentless ascent through the ranks of the Magisterial order, fueled by her unwavering determination and meticulous approach.

Despite achieving the esteemed status of Magister and unlocking the coveted Sixth Seal, Valeska encountered an insurmountable barrier that prevented her from ascending to the ranks of the nobility. The entrenched power of the old bloodlines that permeated the spires conspired against this newcomer, obstructing any path to upward mobility for the Novus Homo. However, fate intervened, and three fortuitous circumstances saved Valeska from a life of mediocrity.

Firstly, her exceptional aptitude for Esoteria set her apart as one of the most gifted practitioners of her generation, affording her unparalleled access to the arcane arts. This remarkable talent, combined with her sharp political acumen, caught the attention of Grand Prince Milov of Novemgrod.

Recognizing her unique blend of cunning and raw power, Milov interceded on her behalf, beseeching the Council to grant her opportunities commensurate with her abilities. Moreover, it was the Council's prejudiced rejection and disdain for the "outsider" that inadvertently spared Valeska's life.

Elevated to a position within the Council, Valeska found herself unwittingly excluded from their grand plan to secure victory in The War. She wept bitter tears upon realizing she would not share in the glory of their triumph. However, the tides of fortune shifted abruptly with The Calamity, turning her perceived loss into both a hollow victory and an inescapable burden.

As the blame for the catastrophe fell squarely upon the shoulders of the Council, the populace directed their ire towards Valeska, the now High Magister. Were it not for the intervention of Prince Ruvan, she would have likely faced condemnation and punishment, consigned to the unforgiving depths of The Murk as retribution for the council's egregious hubris.

Now, Valeska presides over a decaying system, perched atop a fragile throne of authority. Her loyal Magisters toil tirelessly, their efforts dedicated to upholding the weakening wards and safeguarding the remnants of the city and its beleaguered inhabitants. Yet, concealed both within the city's boundaries and amidst the alabaster walls of The Spire, clandestine movements fester, plotting to enact a radical transformation of the prevailing regime. The burden resting upon Valeska's shoulders is immeasurable, for all bear witness to the Council's role in precipitating the great Calamity, and no act can absolve them of their collective guilt.

## Woe of the Commons

The soldier, the farmer, and the factory worker—these stalwart individuals have weathered the trials and tribulations of the past three decades with a resilient determination. Their unwavering resolve to forge a better life for themselves and their loved ones has been met with relentless obstacles imposed by higher powers. In the eyes of princes and high priests, the lives of ten common people hold little significance when weighed against the grand struggles of nations and souls. What price must be paid for the happiness of orphans and the destitute amidst the machinations of power?

Nevertheless, they persist, day in and day out, toiling ceaselessly, brick by brick, as the unsung architects of a new world. It is they who bear the burden of rebuilding, even when their efforts are exploited by their superiors, for whom their plight often goes unnoticed. Blinded by their entourage of counselors, princes fail to perceive the struggles of the common folk. While the churches offer assistance, they exact a spiritual toll, demanding adherence to rituals and beliefs. In the aftermath of the war, many have lost faith, although their deep-seated superstitions remain entrenched. The mention of Esoteria—the forbidden realm of forbidden knowledge—is deemed taboo at most dinner tables, alongside the contentious topic of politics. Both subjects have claimed the lives of their sons, brothers, and fathers, and the resentments borne from these losses shall remain until death claims them.

Yet amidst their collective hardships, a flickering ember of hope endures within their hearts. They cherish the noble aspirations that reside within them, safeguarding their dreams even as they harbor skepticism. Their spirits may be wounded, but the indomitable spirit of resilience remains, a testament to their unwavering determination to preserve their dignity and seek justice. For within the unyielding resolve of these unsung heroes lies the potential for change, a silent rebellion against the forces that have sought to subjugate them. Though their voices may not always be heard, their silent struggle continues, a testament to the enduring strength of the human spirit in the face of adversity.

## Rising Opportunists

Driven to the brink by the absence of legal avenues for survival and upward mobility, a significant portion of the lower classes finds solace in the embrace of criminality. Organized crime syndicates and gangs weave their intricate webs of influence, entrenching themselves within the fabric of almost every neighborhood in the sprawling expanse of major cities. Astonishingly, a few of these criminal entities have even been granted official recognition by the ruling elite, trading the semblance of legitimacy in exchange for maintaining a semblance of order within the city's confines.

Simultaneously, another contingent of society seeks refuge in the realm of Freelancery, gravitating towards the ranks of mercenary companies or even forming their own. Comprising veterans of The War, these groups are veiled in the guise of professional soldiers but often bear an uncanny resemblance to hired brigands. When challenges emerge that cannot be openly addressed by the Princes or their courtiers, they reluctantly turn to these costly yet expendable factions, entrusting them with the delicate task of resolving matters discreetly, away from the prying eyes of the public.

The rise of these alternative paths is a testament to the fraying social fabric and the erosion of trust in traditional systems of governance. Faced with limited opportunities for legal advancement or fair treatment, individuals from the lower echelons of society have been compelled to venture into the shadowy realms of organized crime or embrace the precarious life of a hired sword. Their choices reflect a profound disillusionment with the prevailing social order, where the rule of law fails to provide equitable opportunities and those in power turn a blind eye to the struggles of the marginalized. It is a stark reminder of the systemic inequalities that continue to plague the realm, pushing its inhabitants to seek unconventional means of survival and justice in a world that has failed them.

## What Lies Ahead?

The future of Novemgrod hangs precariously in the balance, as uncertainty shrouds the city in an aura of mystery and apprehension. Whispers of clandestine cults, their dark rituals concealed in the cloak of night, permeate the outskirts, adding an air of eerie intrigue to the already tumultuous atmosphere. Meanwhile, the diligent delvers, braving the treacherous remnants of the fallen city, unearth cryptic artifacts and relics that hint at forgotten secrets and hidden truths.

Both the Prince and the High Magister, the pillars of authority in Novemgrod, cling to power with a tenuous grip, unaware of the fragility of their positions. Their threads of control are worn thin, susceptible to unforeseen forces that lurk in the shadows, poised to unravel the very fabric of their rule. The Prince, burdened with the weight of his family's heroic legacy, faces the constant struggle to assert his authority and navigate the intricate webs of court intrigue. Meanwhile, the High Magister, Valeska, finds herself in a position of immense responsibility, burdened not only by the crumbling remnants of a broken system but also by the knowledge of the Council's complicity in the calamity that befell the city.

In this climate of uncertainty and vulnerability, the destiny of Novemgrod hangs in the balance. Will the secrets whispered in the dark bring about salvation or damnation? Can the delvers' discoveries hold the key to uncovering the city's hidden past and shaping its future? As the Prince and the High Magister teeter on the edge of their authority, unaware of the forces conspiring against them, the threads that bind Novemgrod's fate together grow ever thinner. The outcome of these tangled events remains elusive, leaving the city and its inhabitants teetering on the precipice of a destiny yet to be revealed.

## Notable Faces

### Prince Ruvan

Prince Ruvan, a figure marked by both resilience and vulnerability, carries a backstory that weaves together strands of longing, determination, and unexpected grace. Born into the noble lineage of Novemgrod, Ruvan's path to power was riddled with challenges and insecurities. His early years were shadowed by the disapproval of his uncle, Milov, who dismissed him as "soft" and lacking worldly knowledge. This constant comparison to his brave and esteemed cousin, Rikov, only deepened Ruvan's feelings of inadequacy.

Physically, Ruvan stands at an average height, his frame stocky and strong from soldiering these last decades. His fair complexion bears the faint remnants of childhood illnesses and adult hardships, which left him marked and scarred in appearance. Yet behind his seemingly frail exterior lies a gaze that reveals an otherworldly insight, hinting at a depth of wisdom and resilience that surpasses his 40 years.

Despite his physical limitations, Ruvan possesses an insatiable thirst for knowledge and a penchant for intellectual pursuits. While his cousin Rikov thrived in the realm of battle, Ruvan found solace within the pages of philosophy and fiction. He immersed himself in the works of great thinkers, seeking refuge in the realms of imagination and introspection.

When The War erupted, fate thrust Ruvan into an unforeseen role. Milov and Rikov, the pillars of his family, entrusted him with the responsibility of leading Novemgrod while they amassed their armies. However, their absence would become permanent, leaving Ruvan to inherit the shattered remains of his home and the daunting task of rebuilding in the shadow of his heroic lineage.

In the face of adversity, Ruvan proved himself a wise and compassionate ruler. He surrounded himself with knowledgeable advisors, valuing their counsel over the corrupt machinations of the Councils. Despite his youthful appearance, Ruvan exhibited a tenacious resolve, venturing into the realm of micromanagement to ensure the well-being of his subjects.

To seek guidance in matters of esoteric nature, Ruvan often sought the company of High Magister Valeska. Their meetings were characterized by a polite and amicable demeanor, borne out of the mutual understanding that their fates were intertwined. The unspoken connection between them, though stifled by their respective stations, hinted at a shared sense of being abandoned by their predecessors and a shared longing for redemption.

Amidst the turmoil that plagues Novemgrod, Ruvan remains a beacon of hope and resilience for his people. His frailty belies a profound strength of character, and his unwavering determination to navigate the treacherous currents of power and rebuild a shattered world fuels the whispers of a brighter future in the hearts of his subjects.

### The High Magister Valeska

High Magister Valeska, a figure shrouded in enigma and tempered by adversity, bears a backstory that intertwines elements of resilience, ambition, and a deep connection to the arcane arts. From humble beginnings, Valeska's journey into the realm of magic was both an escape and a means to transcend her circumstances.

Born into a modest family in the outskirts of Novemgrod, Valeska's early years were marked by poverty and struggle. Her father, a rudimentary Esoterist, instilled in her a fascination with the mystical and the arcane. It was through her father's guidance and her own innate talent that she discovered her affinity for manipulating the forces of Esoteria.

Valeska's appearance is striking and beguiling, with flowing raven-black hair that cascades down her back like a midnight waterfall. Her piercing, almond-shaped eyes possess an ethereal quality, their vibrant blue hue often shimmering with a hint of secrets and hidden knowledge. Adorned in flowing robes of deep indigo, she carries an aura of both authority and mystery, her presence commanding attention and respect.

In her pursuit of arcane mastery, Valeska dedicated countless hours to honing her skills and unraveling the complexities of Esoteria. Her relentless determination and thirst for knowledge led her to ascend the ranks of the Magisterial order, even in the face of prejudice and opposition from the old bloods that clung to the traditional hierarchy.

However, her ascent was not without its share of sacrifices. As Valeska unlocked the Sixth Seal, a potent symbol of her mastery over Esoteria, she found herself barred from attaining nobility, a privilege reserved for those born into the old bloodlines. This injustice fueled her ambition, driving her to prove herself worthy of recognition and respect.

It was Grand Prince Milov of Novemgrod who recognized Valeska's political acumen and unparalleled magical prowess. He saw in her the ideal combination of cunning and raw power required to navigate the treacherous corridors of power. Impressed by her abilities, he implored the Council to grant her a seat, elevating her to the esteemed position of High Magister.

As High Magister, Valeska stands at the precipice of a creaking and failing system, shouldering the weight of both responsibility and blame. Her days are filled with tireless efforts to keep the wards intact, preserving what remains of the city and its inhabitants. Many within and outside the alabaster walls of The Spire, disillusioned by the actions of the Council and the Spire itself, secretly conspire for regime change, placing Valeska in a precarious position where her every move is scrutinized.

In her private moments, Valeska often retreats to her study, surrounded by ancient tomes and arcane artifacts. There, she delves into the mysteries of forbidden knowledge, seeking insights and solutions to the challenges that beset Novemgrod. Her unwavering dedication to her craft is matched only by her desire to atone for the sins of the Council and find redemption for their hubris that led to The Calamity.

Haunted by the betrayal of her former allies, Valeska treads a delicate path, knowing that the trust of the populace hangs in the balance. She carries within her a burning desire to reshape the city, to forge a future where the mistakes of the past are not repeated, and where her mastery of Esoteria can be channeled toward the betterment of Novemgrod.

### Victor Volkov

Victor Volkov, widely known as "The Vors," is a formidable figure who holds significant influence over the city of Novemgrod. Born into the underbelly of the city, Victor's upbringing was marked by poverty and violence. As a young man, he quickly learned that survival in this harsh environment required a certain ruthlessness and cunning. With a sharp mind and a natural talent for strategic thinking, Victor rose through the ranks of the criminal underworld, establishing himself as a force to be reckoned with.

In appearance, Victor cuts an imposing figure. Standing tall and broad-shouldered, he exudes an air of authority and confidence. His dark, piercing eyes seem to hold the weight of the secrets he carries, and a permanent five o'clock shadow adds to his mysterious allure. Victor's strong jawline and rugged features give him an aura of rugged charm, though his cold and calculating demeanor serves as a constant reminder of the dangers lurking beneath his charismatic exterior.

Known for his shrewd business acumen, Victor has managed to extend his influence beyond traditional criminal activities. Understanding the power dynamics of Novemgrod, he has taken control of the city's security, effectively becoming the manager of the royal guard. While The Stroidan, his loyal gang, engages in extortion and other illicit activities, Victor ensures that they maintain a delicate balance of power, preventing outright chaos and ensuring relative peace on the streets. Despite his criminal activities, he maintains a certain code of honor within his organization, punishing those who overstep boundaries and providing a sense of security for the citizens who would otherwise be left vulnerable.

Beyond his criminal empire, Victor possesses a keen intellect and a deep understanding of the city's power dynamics. He carefully navigates the complex political landscape, forging alliances and manipulating key players to further his own interests. While his actions may seem self-serving, Victor believes that he is the true guardian of Novemgrod, protecting it from internal and external threats in his own ruthless way.

However, despite his power and influence, Victor remains a mysterious and enigmatic figure. His true motivations and long-term goals are known only to a select few, and his actions often leave those around him questioning their loyalties. His ability to inspire fear and command respect has made him a figure of both admiration and trepidation, and many wonder if there is more to Victor Volkov than meets the eye.

### Erika Stein

Erika Stein's early years were marked by tragedy and hardship, as she was orphaned by the devastating event known as The Black Day. With the loss of her parents, she found herself alone and vulnerable in a world shattered by chaos. Stripped of her familial support, she was forced to navigate the harsh realities of life in a workcamp, where she witnessed firsthand the cruelty and injustice endured by the less fortunate.

Growing up in the workcamp, Erika became acutely aware of the stark divide between the privileged and the oppressed. The daily struggles, meager living conditions, and backbreaking labor shaped her perception of the world and fueled a burning desire for change. She saw the wealthy elites thriving while the working class toiled endlessly to eke out a meager existence. Determined to challenge this unjust status quo, Erika began to find solace in the collective strength of the laborers around her.

In appearance, Erika is a striking figure with fiery red hair that cascades down her back. Her piercing green eyes reflect a sense of determination and unwavering resolve.

Despite the difficult circumstances, Erika's resilient spirit remained unbroken.

As she grew older, her experiences in the workcamp and her passion for justice drove her to become a fierce advocate for the rights of the working class.

Erika's time in the workcamp instilled in her a deep sense of empathy and solidarity with those who shared her struggles. She became a voice for the voiceless, organizing secret meetings and clandestine discussions to empower her fellow laborers. Through her unwavering determination and natural leadership skills, she rallied others to stand up against their oppressors, even in the face of harsh repercussions.

It was during this formative period that Erika developed her skills as an agitator and learned the art of civil disobedience. She recognized the power of collective action and used her knowledge to strategize and plan acts of resistance, including acts of corporate vandalism aimed at disrupting the operations of the powerful corporations that perpetuated the exploitation of the working class.

Erika's journey from orphanhood to becoming a prominent union agitator and community leader is a testament to her resilience and unwavering commitment to justice. Her experiences in the workcamp not only shaped her understanding of the oppressive systems at play but also fueled her determination to dismantle them. Erika's childhood hardships became the driving force behind her tireless efforts to fight for the rights and dignity of the working class, leaving an indelible mark on the city of Novemgrod.

### Elsbeth Von Bergmann

Elsbeth was born into the aristocratic Von Bergmann family, renowned for their wealth and influence in the region. However, tragedy struck her at a young age when her parents succumbed to a fatal illness during an outbreak that swept through the city. Left orphaned and alone, Elsbeth's life took a dramatic turn.

Without any close relatives to take her in, Elsbeth was placed under the care of a distant relative who showed little interest in her well-being.

It was within those walls that Elsbeth discovered a love for knowledge and an insatiable thirst for learning.

Despite her circumstances, Elsbeth's natural intelligence and determination shone through. She dedicated herself to her studies, devouring books on a wide range of subjects, from history and philosophy to politics and economics. This thirst for knowledge became her driving force, empowering her to rise above her difficult circumstances.

Her unwavering determination, compassionate nature, and sharp intellect make her a formidable force in the pursuit of a more just and equitable world.

## Notable Factions

### The Stroidan

The Stroidan, a notorious criminal network that operates in the shadows of Novemgrod, is a clandestine organization renowned for its intricate web of criminal activities and its iron grip on the city's underworld. Born out of the chaos and lawlessness that followed The Black Day, this network has grown to become a formidable force, exerting its influence on every aspect of the city's criminal landscape.

The Stroidan operates with meticulous precision and unwavering ruthlessness. They have established a vast network of skilled criminals, informants, and corrupt officials who help maintain their stranglehold on the city. Under the cover of darkness, The Stroidan orchestrates a wide range of illicit activities, including smuggling, extortion, drug trafficking, and assassination.

One of the key figures within The Stroidan is Viktor Volkov, a cunning and ruthless crime lord who commands respect and fear from both his subordinates and rival factions. Viktor has established his dominance by capitalizing on the weakened state of the city's law enforcement, as the royal guard has been unable to replenish its ranks. He has taken over the security operations in Novemgrod, providing protection to businesses and residents in exchange for a hefty fee. While his gang may engage in extortion and other criminal acts, they also play a role in maintaining a fragile semblance of order in the city, preventing total anarchy from taking hold.

The Stroidan thrives on secrecy and operates through a complex system of codes, hidden symbols, and covert communication channels. Its members wear black veils or masks, obscuring their identities and adding an air of mystique to their criminal activities. This secrecy allows the organization to evade the prying eyes of the authorities and maintain control over their illicit operations.

Within the criminal network, there are various specialized divisions, each with their own area of expertise. These divisions include skilled thieves, master forgers, talented assassins, and adept hackers. The Stroidan prides itself on recruiting individuals with unique skills and exceptional abilities, ensuring that they have a competitive edge over rival criminal organizations and law enforcement agencies.

While The Stroidan operates primarily for its own gain, it is not uncommon for them to strike deals or form temporary alliances with other criminal groups or corrupt officials to further their influence and protect their interests. They have a reputation for being swift and merciless in dealing with those who betray their trust or attempt to undermine their operations.

The true extent of The Stroidan's influence and power remains a mystery to most, as their activities are shrouded in darkness and secrecy. Their vast network extends far beyond the borders of Novemgrod, infiltrating neighboring cities and regions, making them a force to be reckoned with in the criminal underworld.

The Stroidan represents a constant threat to the fragile stability of Novemgrod, with their activities undermining the efforts of law-abiding citizens and posing challenges to the authorities. The Prince and other key figures in the city must tread carefully, aware that The Stroidan's reach extends into the highest echelons of power. Unmasking and dismantling this criminal network is a formidable task that requires unwavering determination and strategic cunning.

### The Bannerless

The Bannerless, born from the ashes of The Great War, was founded as a chaptered organization by veterans who had witnessed the devastating consequences of conflict. Recognizing the need for stability and unity across the warring kingdoms, these brave individuals banded together to form a formidable force dedicated to upholding peace and safeguarding the innocent.

In its early days, the primary objective of The Bannerless was to bridge the divides between the factions and ensure lasting stability. The founding members understood that by uniting the soldiers who had fought on opposite sides, they could foster understanding, heal wounds, and forge a path towards reconciliation. Their aim was to create a new era marked by cooperation and mutual respect.

As the war ended three decades ago, many of the original founders have now passed on the mantle to the next generation. The legacy of The Bannerless runs deep within their bloodlines, and the children of these esteemed veterans have been inducted into the chapters. Guided by the wisdom and experiences of their parents, they continue the noble mission, carrying the torch of unity and justice forward.

Each chapter within The Bannerless possesses a distinct identity, shaped by the city in which it resides. These identities are a reflection of the unique cultures, customs, and challenges that each city faces. However, despite these individual characteristics, all members of The Bannerless welcome one another with open arms. Bonds of brotherhood and sisterhood are forged across cities and regions, fostering a spirit of camaraderie, respect, and shared purpose.
While the chapters maintain their own local operations and initiatives, they remain united under the banner of The Bannerless. Regular gatherings, training sessions, and exchange programs are held to foster a sense of unity and to ensure that members benefit from the collective knowledge and experiences of their peers.

The Bannerless's strength lies not only in the diverse skills and expertise of its members but also in the solidarity and mutual support they offer one another. Members from different chapters often come together to tackle larger threats that transcend city boundaries, drawing on their collective resources and knowledge to face challenges with a united front.

As The Bannerless continues to evolve and expand, its influence and impact spread across the realms. The organization's commitment to stability, justice, and peace resonates deeply within its members and extends to the communities they serve. With each passing year, The Bannerless's reach extends further, its members standing as beacons of hope and exemplars of unity in a world often marked by division.

Driven by the legacy of the great war, The Bannerless remains dedicated to forging a better future for all. Through their unwavering determination and shared values, they inspire others to overcome strife and seek common ground. As they move forward, embracing the challenges that lie ahead, The Bannerless stands as a testament to the power of unity, collaboration, and the indomitable spirit of those who refuse to let history repeat itself.

### The Foundation

The Foundation, a mysterious organization that resides in the shadows, has garnered its fair share of critics who claim that there is more to it than meets the eye. While publicly presenting themselves as an esteemed group of intellectuals and scholars, their detractors argue that The Foundation conceals a darker agenda beneath its façade of enlightenment.

At the helm of this clandestine organization are a group of disenchanted nobles, who may outwardly serve Prince Ruvan but harbor a deep dissatisfaction with his rule. These individuals, yearning for greater influence and power, find solace within the folds of The Foundation. It is here that they convene, sharing their discontent and plotting their own clandestine endeavors.

Central to The Foundation's operations is their private library, meticulously curated to house a vast collection of Esoteria. This secretive repository serves as a gathering place for the members, granting them exclusive access to ancient and forbidden knowledge. Within the hallowed halls of the library, esoteric texts and artifacts are preserved and studied, delving into the realms of magic, mysticism, and the occult.

However, The Foundation's activities extend beyond the pursuit of esoteric knowledge. While they engage in philanthropic efforts that are seemingly driven by a desire to uplift the community, their true motivations lie in achieving ulterior goals. Behind the veil of charitable endeavors, they strategically deploy their resources and influence to manipulate situations to their advantage. These acts of philanthropy serve as a means to gain favor, influence key individuals, or secure crucial alliances necessary for their hidden agendas.
The Foundation's true intentions and the extent of their actions remain shrouded in secrecy. Whispers among the populace hint at their involvement in covert operations, political maneuverings, and even darker rituals. Critics allege that The Foundation's pursuit of power and control surpasses their professed commitment to enlightenment and progress.

While some may view The Foundation as a beacon of knowledge and intellectual prowess, others regard it with suspicion and fear. They question the true nature of this organization, wary of the hidden forces that may be at play behind closed doors. As rumors swirl and dissenting voices grow louder, The Foundation's grip on the shadows tightens, concealing their true motives and leaving the populace to wonder what machinations lie beneath their enlightened facade.

### Temnovus

Deep in the shadows of Novemgrad, a mysterious and clandestine group known as the Temnovus thrives, shrouded in secrecy and darkness. Their members remain elusive and hidden, their identities veiled behind a web of intrigue and anonymity. No one knows for certain who is part of this enigmatic organization, as they operate with utmost discretion, silently moving through the city's corridors undetected.

The Temnovus, driven by an insatiable fascination with the dark, have left their mark upon the city's landscape. From time to time, their symbol emerges, painted in cryptic patterns upon public areas. It serves as a chilling reminder of their presence, an invitation to those who dare to seek the secrets they hold. Yet, it is not only in public displays that their symbol manifests. In the depths of hidden chambers and forsaken corners, the Temnovus conducts their dark rituals, invoking forces beyond comprehension. Authorities stumble upon these eerie symbols, evidence of the Temnovus' sinister practices, fueling speculation and fear.

Rumors abound that the Temnovus worships The Murk, an entity shrouded in mystique and darkness. Some believe that the cult channels the very power of The Murk, drawing upon its enigmatic energy for their own purposes. The Murk's association with chaos and the unknown instills a sense of unease in the hearts of the people, further fueling the suspicion surrounding the Temnovus.

Despite being strictly forbidden in Novemgrad, the allure of the Temnovus persists. The city's authorities have waged a relentless battle to suppress their activities, but their efforts have met limited success. Symbols of the Temnovus continue to materialize in unexpected places, a silent defiance against the established order. And people, unfortunate souls, occasionally vanish without a trace, their disappearances seemingly linked to the enigmatic cult.

In the darkness of night, the Temnovus thrives, weaving its web of secrets and manipulating the unseen forces that dwell within the shadows. Novemgrad remains a city plagued by the lingering presence of this forbidden cult, its symbol a haunting reminder of their existence, and the uncertainty of what lies hidden in the depths of their twisted devotion.

## Notable Locations

### The Forges

Nestled amidst the remnants of the Great War factories, The Forges stand as a testament to the enduring spirit of Novemgrod's workforce. Once bustling centers of mass production, these factories now serve as a combined residential and industrial hub for thousands of workers who call them home.

Within the dilapidated walls of The Forges, a unique system has taken root. Failed magisters, those who couldn't ascend to the noble ranks of their order, find employment as enchanters, infusing specialist items with magical properties. Despite their lack of recognition in the esteemed Magisterial hierarchy, these individuals possess a deep understanding of esoteria and use their skills to create enchantments that give an edge to weapons, armor, and various other survival tools.

The Forges have become a vital source of essential materials necessary for survival in Novemgrod. Workers toil day and night, producing weapons, ammunition, and other supplies needed to protect themselves in the ever-uncertain world beyond the city's walls. The clanging of hammers and the rhythmic pounding of the forge reverberate through the air, serving as a constant reminder of the industriousness that fuels the city's survival.

While the factories themselves may be the lifeblood of the city, they are not under the direct control of the government or the ruling class. Instead, a single committee of wealthy individuals has taken charge of running The Forges. These influential figures, driven by their own self-interest, exploit the labor of the workers for personal gain. They pay exorbitant sums to The Stroidan, a powerful criminal organization, to ensure the populace remains compliant and the factories remain operational.

However, the working conditions within The Forges are far from ideal. The pursuit of profit takes precedence over the safety and well-being of the workers. The factories are plagued by neglect, with outdated equipment and crumbling infrastructure. Industrial accidents are a grim reality, and tragic deaths occur on a weekly basis. Workers risk their lives daily in hazardous environments, where inadequate safety measures and lack of proper training contribute to the alarming rate of accidents.

Despite the dangers, the workers of The Forges continue their labor, driven by necessity and the hope for a better future. Their resilience and determination to provide for their families and survive in a harsh world are unmatched. The industrial district becomes a place of both struggle and camaraderie, where solidarity among the workers is born out of shared hardships.

Within The Forges, whispers of discontent and calls for better working conditions grow louder. Unions and activists emerge, seeking to agitate for change and improve the lives of the workers. Their efforts, however, are met with resistance from the committee and their hired enforcers from The Stroidan, who protect the interests of the wealthy elite at the expense of the workers' well-being.

The Forges, with its sprawling factories and the pervasive presence of The Stroidan, stands as a stark symbol of the harsh realities faced by the working class in Novemgrod. It is a place where hope and desperation intertwine, where lives are lost amidst the clatter of machinery, and where the struggle for survival unfolds against a backdrop of industrial oppression.

### The Mist Cliffs

Nestled on the outskirts of Novemgrod, the Mist Cliffs stand as a haunting testament to the catastrophic events of the Black Day. As the earth trembled and shifted, a large section of the city plunged several hundred feet into the depths of the Murk, forever altering the landscape. The remnants of revered temples and grand architectural marvels now lay submerged below the ominous line of the Mist Cliffs, their former glory obscured by the murky abyss.

Despite the dangers that lurk within the depths, a brave and intrepid group known as the Divers emerges. These explorers, as the locals call them, accept the treacherous task of descending the Mist Cliffs to retrieve the lost artifacts and remnants of a bygone era. Equipped with specialized gear and harnesses, they navigate the precipitous edges, suspended by cranes that dangle precariously over the chasm. The Divers face constant peril as they maneuver through the swirling mist, their every movement a battle against the unknown.

The Mist Cliffs hold an eerie allure, a place where the boundary between the mortal realm and the Murk becomes blurred. Standing near the edge, one may sense a palpable presence, a ghostly touch that sends shivers down the spine. As the thick mist envelops the surroundings, subtle shapes and shadows emerge from the depths, their forms indiscernible yet undeniably otherworldly. Whispers drift through the air, echoing from unseen sources, their words lost in an incomprehensible language. Only those who have stood at the precipice for too long can attest to the unsettling sensation of being watched by unseen eyes.

The Mist Cliffs serve as a constant reminder of the profound tragedy that befell Novemgrod on the Black Day. Yet, they also beckon to the adventurous souls who are willing to risk their lives in search of lost relics and fragments of history. The mist-clad expanse conceals untold secrets, waiting to be unearthed by the courageous Divers who dare to descend into the depths. As they embark on their perilous journeys, the Mist Cliffs remain a testament to the city's enduring spirit and the enigmatic mysteries that lie within the ever-present embrace of the Murk.

### St. Vikal's Cathedrals

The St. Vikals Cathedral, once a revered symbol of worship and spirituality in Novemgrod, now stands as a solemn reminder of a bygone era. In the days before the Black Day, Le Vides reigned as a primary deity, his presence deeply woven into the fabric of the city's religious and cultural identity. The grand Cathedral, with its towering spires and intricate carvings, served as a sacred haven where devoted followers sought solace and guidance.

However, on that fateful day, as chaos and destruction descended upon Novemgrod, the priests of Le Vides noticed an unsettling silence in their prayers. The absence of the god's divine presence reverberated not only throughout the city but across the entire realm of Ereb. Speculations abound, with some believing that Le Vides has forsaken the people, while others entertain the possibility of the god's demise amidst the cataclysmic events of the Black Day.

Over the years, the once-vibrant Cathedral gradually fell into disrepair and abandonment. Its hallowed halls, once filled with the harmonious echoes of worship, now bear witness to the footsteps of the desperate and unhinged who seek refuge within its weathered walls. Among them, the Penitient Choir emerged—a faith born from the void left by Le Vides' absence. They took ownership of a portion of the Cathedral, utilizing it for their modest acts of worship, while the remaining areas now serve as a sanctuary for countless refugees displaced by the aftermath of the Black Day.

As one approaches the St. Vikals Cathedral, the grandeur of its Gothic architecture commands attention. The structure rises majestically, its stone façade adorned with intricate gargoyles and stained glass windows that, although faded and cracked, still bear fragments of their former brilliance. The towering spires reach towards the heavens, an enduring testament to the devotion and craftsmanship of the builders who erected this sacred edifice. Inside, the atmosphere is a mixture of reverence and desolation, as the faint scent of incense lingers amidst the echoes of distant footsteps. The flickering candlelight casts dancing shadows upon the worn pews, and the air carries a sense of longing and spiritual yearning that mingles with the heavy weight of uncertainty.

## Exploring Novemgrod

Novemgrod, in its post-Black Day state, presents a labyrinthine challenge to those who dare to navigate its streets. The city's rebuilding efforts, though commendable, have resulted in a patchwork of confusing thoroughfares. Streets abruptly end at fallen structures, leading to dead ends that bewilder even the most seasoned residents. In this maze of reconstructed chaos, street names have become mere whispers, replaced by the colloquial monikers known only to the locals. Novemgrod, therefore, remains a perplexing and disorienting place for all who venture through its convoluted pathways.

The city is divided into distinct districts, each with its own character and challenges. The Hollowed Quarter, positioned adjacent to the ever-menacing Murk, bears witness to the relentless encroachment of the Murktide during its tumultuous surges. Few individuals permanently reside in these desolate ruins, for it is a place haunted by shadows and uncertainty. However, whispers spread of an underground tunnel network that weaves through the Hollowed Quarter, serving as a lifeline for those who still call this forsaken place their home.

On the precipice of the Mistcliffs lies Cliffwall, a neighborhood defined by its proximity to both the ethereal mists and the city's neglect. It becomes a refuge for those unable to afford a safer abode elsewhere. In this district, peculiar occurrences abound, a result of the confluence between the ever-looming presence of the Murk and the absence of proper security. The denizens of Cliffwall endure a precarious existence, navigating the treacherous boundaries of the unknown.

The Palace District, although stripped of its opulence, still retains a regal air, serving as the enduring symbol of power and authority. While the buildings here have been stripped of their once-ornate gold and precious materials to aid in the city's reconstruction, the district remains a well-organized bastion of governance. It is within these hallowed grounds that Prince Ruvan strives to maintain his grasp on the remnants of his city, making calculated decisions that shape the fate of Novemgrod.

To the west lies WestWard, the pulsating heart of industry and the home of the Forge. This bustling district resonates with the incessant rhythm of hammer upon anvil, as skilled craftsmen and laborers toil ceaselessly to produce the materials essential for survival. The air is thick with smoke, a testament to the tireless efforts undertaken within these industrial grounds. WestWard thrives as a vital cog in the machinery of Novemgrod's resilience.

GreenSide, a verdant suburb, stands as a testament to the city's agricultural prowess. Here, fertile fields stretch out as far as the eye can see, yielding abundant crops that sustain the populace and nourish trade. The district serves as a bustling hub for shipping and receiving, with a particular focus on the agricultural sector. Amidst the bountiful harvests, GreenSide boasts the largest skydock in Novemgrod, facilitating the efficient transportation of goods via airships that dot the sky.

Thus, within the enigmatic tapestry of Novemgrod's districts, a microcosm of contrasting worlds emerges. From the haunting recesses of the Hollowed Quarter to the stoic grandeur of the Palace District, from the clamor of industry in WestWard to the vibrant abundance of GreenSide, Novemgrod's diverse districts reflect the resilience and adaptability of its inhabitants in the face of adversity. Each district contributes its own unique flavor to the city's tapestry, weaving together the story of a once-great metropolis that continues to struggle for survival amidst the encroaching shadows.

## Exploring the Murk

In the treacherous realm of the Murk, explorers tread a path fraught with constant tension and an overwhelming sense of the unknown. The very essence of the Murk seems to possess an insidious intelligence, manipulating its density to confound and disorient those who dare to venture into its domain. The air they breathe is tainted, carrying a spectral miasma that permeates their senses and gnaws at their sanity. It is a place where reality warps and twists, shrouded in an enigmatic haze that defies comprehension.

The beings rumored to inhabit the Murk are whispered about in hushed tones, their true nature shrouded in mystery. Some say they are spectral apparitions, fleeting shadows that dance at the periphery of vision before vanishing into the depths. Others claim they are monstrous entities, born from the darkest recesses of nightmares, lurking within the murky abyss. Yet, despite the tales and whispers, encounters with these entities remain elusive, leaving explorers to question the veracity of their own perceptions and the true nature of the Murk's inhabitants.

Navigating the ever-changing tide of the Murk requires not only courage but also a keen sense of timing and intuition. Its fluctuations, like the rhythmic ebb and flow of an otherworldly ocean, create an atmosphere of constant suspense. One moment, the Murk may recede, unveiling an ethereal landscape bathed in an eerie luminescence, only to surge forward in the next instant, threatening to engulf all in its tenebrous embrace. These unpredictable shifts of the Murk's boundaries transform the borderlands into a treacherous labyrinth, where one wrong step can plunge explorers into a perilous chasm of uncertainty.

As explorers delve deeper into the Murk, a sense of unease settles in their hearts. It is not just the physical dangers that haunt their every step, but the psychological toll as well. The Murk has a way of whispering to their souls, seducing them with tantalizing secrets or luring them towards unseen perils. Its insidious influence slowly gnaws at their resolve, testing their sanity and resolve as they navigate the unfathomable depths. Only the strongest-willed and most resolute dare to persist in their quest, driven by an insatiable curiosity or a desperate need to unravel the mysteries hidden within the Murk's veiled embrace.

In the ever-shifting expanse of the Murk, where reality intertwines with the unknown, brave souls forge their path, driven by an unyielding determination to discover the truth. They are the Divers, fearless explorers who risk life and sanity in their pursuit of knowledge and revelation. Their tales are whispered in hushed tones, passed down through generations, weaving a tapestry of awe and dread. For within the Murk lies not only darkness and danger, but also the potential for untold discoveries and profound revelations
